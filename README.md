# PyBor: A Python library for borrowing detection based on lexical language models

`pybor` is a library to aid in the detection of borrowings in mono- and multi-lingual
concept lists. It implements a variety of statistical methods that can be used
individually or in combination, intended for supporting expert decisions in a
computer-assisted framework.

`pybor` can be used both as a Python library or as a stand-alone, command-line tool.
It is distributed along with example data that can be used to bootstrap other
analyses.

## Installation and usage

Upon release, it will be possible to install the library as any standard Python
package with `pip`. Currently, the library must be installed from source:

```bash
$ pip install .
```

To use the default `wold` package, you will also need to install it in edit mode:

```bash
$ pip install -e wold/
```

Detailed instructions can be found in the [docs](official documentation).
