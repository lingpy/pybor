One is that most of the existing literature on the loan component of Swahili lexis is exclusively concerned with non-Bantu donor languages. Secondly, I am not certain that all sound changes have been applied to all lexical items in a regular fashion (e.g., *l-deletion).

This judgment would also apply to lexical similarities in terms of form and meaning across rather large geographic distance, such as, for instance, with  j\u00ednk\u00e1a  \u2018the thatching\u2019  which looks a bit like the word jonge  \u2018the thatching\u2019  in Mande (Niger-Congo) which is a less likely contact language.\n\n(ii) Perhaps borrowed\napplies to words which, on the one hand, would appear to be reconstructable to Proto-Afro-Asiatic (PAA) yet lacks regularity in terms of sound changes; cf. the noun s\u00e2a \u2018the ox\u2019 \u00edn Hausa to be compared to *hla in PAA. However, Newman (1977) suggests that regular phonological change of  PAA lateral fricative *hl should give initial l or r for Hausa (cf. the etymological reflex in closely related Angas: lon). This judgement also applies to words which other authors have considered likely loans, somewhat contrary to our own opinion, such as with the verb l\u00e0as\u00e1a  \u2018to lick\u2019 for which Jungraithmayr / Ibriszimow (1994) maintain that \u201cungraded Hausa 'l\u00e0\u00e0s\u00e1\u00e1'  may be of Arabic origin, since initial 'l-' in Hausa does not point to great antiquity\u201d. We have also applied this judgment to words which strongly resemble words in probable contact languages, even though their onomatopoetic features could point into the direction of rather universal distribution (cf. \u201cvery little evidence for borrowing\u201d above):cf. Hausa  \u00e0gw\u00e0agw\u00e1 \u2018the duck\u2019 and compare it with gbangban, gbamgba   \u2018the duck\u2019 in Nupe, both could be onomatopoeic in origin and need not represent borrowing. In other cases, borrowing is a likely hypothesis, if we are not dealing with chance resemblance, cf. Hausa \u00edc\u00e8e \u2018wood/tree\u2019 and  idi \u2018tree\u2019 in Tubu (Saharan).\n\n(iii) Probably borrowed \napplies to some probable Arabic loans which, however, don\u2019t violate assumed phonotactic rules of Hausa (and Chadic languages in general) and, therefore, could be considered common heritage from Proto-Afroasiatic but were we have judged them to be Afroasiatic-internal loans instead. This judgement is also applied to words which again don\u2019t necessarily violate phonological patterns of Hausa but which are also present in some contact languages where they appear to match the phonotactics of the languages even better.

We also consulted Bender (1996) and Ehret (2001) for highly tentative and mostly rather speculative reconstructions of and within Proto-Nilosaharan. \n\nIn terms of our rather tentative guesses on the age of loans, we use the following chronological approximations:\n\nProto-Saharan period: \t8,000 \u2013 3,000 BCE\n\nProto-West Saharan period:\t 3,000 BCE\n\nAncient Areal Roots = Proto-Saharan period, possibly shared settlements with Proto-Chadic speakers\n\nFor the Kanuri language, we use the following guesses to relevant periods:\n\nPre-modern Islamic period\t1000 - 1900\n\nPre-modern non-Islamic period\t\tbefore 1900\n\nPre-modern Hausa contact period               \t1300 - 1900\n\nModern (colonial & postcolonial) period \t1900 - date\n\nWith regard to chronology, we suggest four major contact periods: \n\n1. Ancient areal contacts between (Pre-)Kanuri/Saharan languages and Afroasiatic (Chadic/Berber/Semitic) languages, possibly also other Nilosaharan and Niger-Congo languages, which precede the advent of Islam/Arabic in the Western and Central Sudan, roughly speaking before 1300.\n\n2. The early Islamic period roughly from about 1300 to 1500 with strong impact of early Arabo-Islamic culture across the Sahel zone south of the Sahara desert either directly or via intermediary languages.\n\n3. The medieval contact period between 1500 and about 1880 in which Hausa becomes a strong source of interference, and possible other indigenous Chadic languages in Borno.\n\n4. The modern colonial and postcolonial period beginning with the advent of colonialism (British in Nigeria, some German in former German Cameroon, and French in modern Niger and Chad) and lasting until the present day. Besides the (ex-)colonial languages English and French, Hausa as the most important lingua franca in the area continues to have an impact on Kanuri, and so does Arabic, whether via Hausa or not, in terms of reference to the \u201cmodern world\u201d."", ""fd_borrowed"": ""The identification of loanwords in Kanuri is usually possible with a high degree of confidence for most of the semantic fields of the LWT list.\n\n1.

This judgement would also apply to lexical similarities in terms of form and meaning across rather large geographic distance. We have identified 5 ancient \u201careal\u201d loans that relate Kanuri words to Afroasiatic in general and that we assume to represent the oldest layer of contact, possibly due to shared settlement areas north of Lake Chad. Chadic substrata are assumed to be responsible for further loans in Kanuri. Chronologically, these might already be related to the westward migration into Borno of the Kanuri, which began in the 11th century. One has to consider family-internal borrowing from another Saharan language, where there is no comparative information available on the word in the other Saharan languages.\n\n2.

The French settlers brought their African slaves along with them to this new subcolony, which was ruled from Mauritius. During the first two decades, the colony was faced with various difficulties, but a demographic boom began around the late 1780s, when under Malavois, the Governor-General for Mauritius and the Seychelles, the economy changed from the mere exploitation of the natural resources to profitable agriculture (cotton, coffee, spices) (Nwulia 1981: 27). By 1791, there were 572 inhabitants in the islands: 65 Europeans, 20 free \u201ccolored\u201d people, and 487 slaves (Chaudenson 1979: 225). Due to a constant demand for servile labor, the population grew constantly, and by 1810 there were 317 European settlers, 135 free \u201ccolored\u201d people and 3,015 slaves in the islands.\n\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, with the Treaty of Paris in 1814, the Seychelles and\nMauritius came under the rule of Britain, whereas Reunion remained under French rule. After 1807 the slave trade was illegal in all British territories, but the colonial authorities found it difficult to implement this ban in the Seychelles and Mauritius. As a consequence, an illegal slave trade started to flourish in the Indian Ocean (Allen 2001: 93, 110). It is estimated that between 1811 and 1827 about 60,000 slaves were exported from Madagascar and East Africa to Mauritius and to the Seychelles (Allen 2001: 111).\n\nAfter the abolition of slavery in 1835, the British Navy captured French ships that still engaged in the slave trade and set the slaves \u201cfree\u201d in the Seychelles. This led to a considerable further influx of Bantu-speaking East Africans in the 19th century.\nWith respect to the evolution of Seychelles Creole, it is crucial to note that when the French colonists, who mainly came from Mauritius, settled the Seychelles, they and their slaves brought some kind of already stabilized Mauritian Creole along with them. Baker & Corne (1986) hypothesize that it was around 1770 that the different varieties spoken in Mauritius \u201cjelled\u201d into a stable creole language. This historical fact is the reason why Seychelles Creole can be characterized as an offshoot of Mauritian Creole. The two modern languages are still mutually intelligible.\n\nIn 1976, the Seychelles became independent, and since 1978 there have been\nthree official languages: English, French and Seychelles Creole (Kreol seselwa). Creole is the native language of about 95% of the population. In 1982 it was introduced as a language of instruction in primary schools and has been used in different formal communication contexts, e.g. television, radio, court, newspaper. But during the last 15 years, the use of written varieties of Seychelles Creole has lost a lot of its former significance.\n\nRegarding the age field , it should be stressed that the age estimates are based on a lot of speculation (much less for the 20th century), and not on the date of the first written attestation of a given word. \nThe following age designations have been used:\n(i) 18th century: all words which are supposed to have been either already part of the Mauritian Creole varieties imported into the Seychelles (in 1770), or words that may have entered Seychelles Creole in this very early stage (1770-1800).\n(ii) 19th century: words which may have entered Seychelles Creole via slaves who mainly came from East Africa speaking eastern Bantu languages or from Madagascar (whereas it is not clear how many Malagasy slaves were brought to the Seychelles during the illegal slave trade in the first decennies of the 19th century (see Michaelis 2008)).\n(iii) 19th or 20th century: a lot of words borrowed from French and English, where a more exact timing seems to be unjustified given the little linguistic evidence.\n(iv) 20th century: clear cases of late borrowings into Seychelles Creole mainly based on the semantics of the lexeme denoting concepts which have only become relevant in the 20th century.\n\nAllen, Richard B. 2001.

Seychelles Creole is regarded as an offshoot of French, and I regard most of its core vocabulary as inherited from earlier French.Thus, dialectal and colonial French varieties of the 17th and 18th centuries spoken by the French settlers constitute the bulk of the Seychelles Creole lexicon. There is clear continuity between French and Seychelles Creole in this respect. In the formation of the contact language, the creole creators came from different social and ethnic backgrounds at different times. It is true that at a later point in the history of the colony, the vast majority of creole language creators were people who natively spoke languages other than French, mainly eastern Bantu languages. However, I assume that speakers from eastern Bantu languages introduced the words of their mother tongues into the evolving creole language, which had its overwhelming lexical base in colonial French overseas varieties.\n\nThe assignments have been used in the following way:\n(i) \""no evidence for borrowing\"" \n\nNearly 90% of the analyzed set of LWT meanings don't show any evidence for borrowing, i.e. all these lexemes have been inherited from 18th century French.\n\n(ii) \""only very little evidence for borrowing\""/\""'perhaps borrowed\""\n\nHere we overwhelmingly find cases where Seychelles Creole words were borrowed from French, its European base language.

The bulk of the lexicon of Seychelles Creole is French-based (18th century spoken French varieties). The French lexemes were introduced into the Creole by the French settlers, but also via the already stabilized French-based Creole varieties of Mauritian Creole, which were introduced by Mauritian settlers and slaves during the first decades of colonization.\n\nAs spoken and written French kept its influence on Seychelles Creole throughout\nthe 19th and 20th centuries (even though in 1814 the Seychelles became part of\nthe British Empire), we expect French words to have entered Seychelles Creole\nduring these two centuries. Moreover, six years after independence, in 1982,\nSeychelles Creole was introduced as a language of instruction in primary schools\nand has been used in different formal communication contexts, e.g. television, radio, court, newspaper, poetry. During this process of creating a written language in addition to the spoken vernacular, a lot of written-style words were borrowed from French into Seychelles Creole. Today, it is extremely difficult to decide on phonological, phonotactic and/or morphological grounds whether a lexeme has been inherited from 18th century colonial French or borrowed from French into the existing Creole during the 19th or 20th centuries. Besides very clear cases of French loanwords, there are nevertheless some 100 lexemes which one could classify as being perhaps a French loanword, e.g. imen \u2018human\u2019 (< French humain). The decision whether a word should be considered a French loan was mostly guided either by the semantics of the lexeme denoting concepts which have only become relevant in the 20th century (e.g. televizyon \u2018television\u2019, < French t\u00e9l\u00e9vision), or by the formal register of a given lexeme for an existing phenomenon (e.g. vilv \u2018vulva\u2019, < French vulve). \n\n(iii) \""Probably borrowed\""\n\nBesides cases of borrowing from formal registers of French into Seychelles Creole, words of non-French heritage for which we often don't have any convincing etymology are also listed under this rubrique, e.g. tonkonny 'the tree stump'.\n\n(iv) \""clearly borrowed\""\nFor all those cases considered as \""clearly borrowed\"", we have good evidence that a given word was borrowed into Seychelles Creole, and furthermore we can trace the word back to its source word in the donor language."", ""fd_contact_situation"": ""Malagasy and Bantu slaves in Mauritius and the Seychelles\n\nAs Seychelles Creole is an offshoot of Mauritian Creole, it is helpful to have a brief look at the contact situations which gave rise to Mauritian Creole. The composition of the slave population during the colonization of Mauritius was as follows: During the first decades, Malagasy slaves made up the majority, except for the short period between 1735 and 1740, when most of the slaves came from Senegambia and the Slave Coast (see African slaves in the 18th century). It is only from the late 1760s onwards that more slaves were brought to Mauritius from East Africa than from Madagascar. By the time of the colonization of the Seychelles in 1770, the slave trade with East Africa provided the great majority of the slaves taken to the Seychelles and the Mascarenes (i.e. Reunion Island and Mauritius), and this continued until the end of the 18th century. Slaves have never been brought directly from West Africa to the Seychelles\n(Baker 1982: 741). Thus, the substrate and adstrate languages of Seychelles Creole must have been on the one hand Malagasy and on the other hand \u2013 much more prominently \u2013 eastern Bantu languages spoken in an area from Zanzibar to southern Mozambique. It also seems that the slavers took their slaves from places quite far inland. Therefore some of the most probable substrate/adstrate languages for Seychelles Creole are languages such as Bemba, Kongo, Makua, Swahili, Sena, Yao (sometimes also refered to in the database as \u201ceastern Bantu\u201d). Since the spread of Bantu languages into eastern and southern Africa is a recent phenomenon (during the last 1,500 years), these languages show a high degree of uniformity, compared to the genealogical and typological diversity of West African languages. Therefore, when I cite etymologies from different eastern Bantu languages, these should be regarded as prototypical examples for eastern Bantu languages of this region. The reader should not infer that for a particular word, only the cited Bantu language should be regarded as the possible source language.\n\nSince during the colonization of the Seychelles, Malagasy slaves made up only a\nsmall proportion compared to slaves from East Africa, we assume that most Malagasy loanwords must have entered Seychelles Creole via Mauritian Creole. With respect to the eastern Bantu contribution to the Seychelles Creole lexicon, there is a stock of words shared by Mauritian Creole and Seychelles Creole, e.g. kalipa \u2018strong\u2019 < kalipa (Makua) \u2018a fighter, a person who is hard to beat\u2019 (Boll\u00e9e 1993\u2013), kourpa \u2018snail\u2019 < ekhoropa (Makua) \u2018snail\u2019. If both Mauritian and Seychelles Creole have the eastern Bantu word, one may assume that this word must have entered Seychelles Creole via its parent language Mauritian Creole. There are however Bantu words which are present in Seychelles Creole but not in Mauritian Creole.\n\n\nBantu slaves in the 19th century\nAnother historical situation in which Bantu lexemes entered the Seychelles Creole lexicon was during the 19th century. A flourishing illegal slave trade between 1811 and 1827 provided Mauritius and the Seychelles with roughly 60,000 slaves from Madagascar and East Africa (Allen 2001: 111).\nMoreover, after the abolition of slavery in 1835, the British Navy captured French\nships still engaging in the slave trade and brought these slaves to the Seychelles.\nThis considerably increased the Bantu-speaking East African population in 19th\ncentury Seychelles, whereas Mauritian planters started to hire large numbers of\nindentured laborers from India. This difference in the population composition of\nthe two islands in the 19th century led to some differences in the lexicon of the two languages. Bantu words which do not exist in Mauritian Creole (not those that are verifiably extinct) are attributed to this Bantu contact in 19th century\nSeychelles, e.g. makeket, maket \u2018a kind of ant\u2019 < ma + ekeketele (Kongo). \n\n\nEnglish influence\nIn 1814 the Seychelles and Mauritius came under British rule, and English began to be an influential language on the islands. After independence in 1976, English has remained the most widely known and spoken language on the Seychelles besides Seychelles Creole. The influence of English on Seychelles Creole\nhas been growing with increasing access to education, media, and travel.\n\nFrench influence\nFrench is the European base language for Seychelles Creole. Besides French settlers from Mauritius and Reunion Island, the islands were also colonized by French colonists who came directly from France. The bulk of the lexicon of Seychelles Creole is French-based (18th century spoken French varieties). The French lexemes were introduced into the Creole by the French settlers, but also via the already stabilized French-based Creole varieties of Mauritian Creole, which were introduced by Mauritian settlers and slaves during the first decades of colonization.\n\nAs spoken and written French kept its influence on Seychelles Creole throughout\nthe 19th and 20th centuries (even though in 1814 the Seychelles became part of\nthe British Empire), we expect French words to have entered Seychelles Creole\nduring these two centuries. Moreover, six years after independence, in 1982,\nSeychelles Creole was introduced as a language of instruction in primary schools\nand has been used in different formal communication contexts, e.g. television, radio, court, newspaper, poetry. During this process of creating a written language in addition to the spoken vernacular, a lot of written-style words were borrowed from French into Seychelles Creole. Today, it is extremely difficult to decide on phonological, phonotactic and/or morphological grounds whether a lexeme has been inherited from 18th century colonial French or borrowed from French into the existing Creole during the 19th or 20th centuries. Besides the very clear cases of French loanwords, there are nevertheless some 100 lexemes which one could classify as being perhaps a French loanword, e.g. imen \u2018human\u2019 (< French humain). The decision whether a word should be considered a French loan was mostly guided either by the semantics of the lexeme denoting concepts which have only become relevant in the 20th century (e.g. televizyon \u2018television\u2019, < French t\u00e9l\u00e9vision), or by the formal register of a given lexeme for an existing phenomenon (e.g. vilv \u2018vulva\u2019, < French vulve).\n\nAfrican slaves in the 18th century\nVery few items can be attributed to West African languages. As was mentioned\nabove, slaves have never been brought directly from West Africa to the Seychelles. Therefore these lexemes must have been introduced via another language, most probably via Mauritian Creole, e.g. tyaptyap \u2018to eat quickly\u2019 < Wolof yapa \u2018to eat avidly\u2019.\n\nOther contact situations\nThere are also a few other donor languages that contributed to the Seychelles\nCreole lexicon. Under the heading \u201cIndian influence\u201d, I have subsumed Hindi-\nUrdu and Tamil, e.g. dalon < Tamil kadalon \u2018friend\u2019. Words from these languages\nmost probably entered Seychelles Creole already via the incipient Mauritian Creole, as there were Indian slaves and free artisans in the first decades of the colonization of Mauritius (Baker 1993: 125). As far as we know there have never been significant numbers of Indian slaves or indentured laborers in the Seychelles. Some Indian words have entered Seychelles Creole through the intermediation of Indo-Portuguese or Indian English as there had always been an intimate Indian Ocean maritime contact over centuries, e.g. Indo-Portuguese (kalen \u2018tin\u2019 < Indo-Portuguese calaim \u2018tin\u2019), Indian English (tifin \u2018a light meal\u2019). It is also via this Indian Ocean maritime contact that some words from Portuguese (kaskavel < cascavel \u2018a kind of rattle\u2019) entered Seychelles Creole.\n\nAllen, Richard B. 2001.

Gro\u00dfes W\u00f6rterbuch der Zigeunersprache. Mannheim [Hamburg: Buske]."", ""fd_age"": ""Age refers to the (diachronic) syntactic or derivation structure of the item, but not to its phonological form or to its meaning. The age of analyzable lexemes (collocations, compounds, and derivations) reflects the time of creation of such complex expressions rather the age of their parts. The relevant units of temporal continuity of univerbal lexemes are inflectional stems. For example, although the \u2018canonical\u2019 forms of the Selice Romani verb d-en \u2018to give\u2019 (citation form: third plural present indicative) do not directly continue the \u2018cannonical\u2019 forms of the Old Indo-Aryan verb d\u0101-da-ti \u2018to give\u2019 (citation form: third singular present indicative), but rather certain inflectional forms without the initial reduplication, there is continuity of the verbs\u2019 inflectional stems between Old Indo-Aryan and Selice Romani, viz.  da  > d-, and so the Selice Romani verb d-en \u2018to give\u2019 may be considered to go back, via Old Indo-Aryan, to Proto-Indo-European deh-  \u2018to give\u2019. Two types of age categories are used:\n\n\u2022\tFirst, there are genealogical age categories (1\u20136). Some of these (1\u20133 and 5) represent nodes on the tree model of the genealogical affiliation of Selice Romani, and are assigned to lexemes that can be reconstructed for these stages of the language. I should note that some lexemes assigned to the OLD INDO-ARYAN category might be actually older, i.e. PROTO-INDO-IRANIAN or even PROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN, as I have only checked for pre-Indo-Aryan etymologies of Old Indo-Aryan etymons selectively. The category LATER THAN EARLY ROMANI includes lexemes that are dialect specific within Romani, i.e. not reconstructable for Early Romani, and that, in addition, are not loanwords, based on loanwords, or calqued from a post-Early Romani L2.\n\n\u2022\tSecond, there are two subtypes of contact-related age categories: those that are defined with reference to the period of contact with an L2 or a cluster of L2s (7\u201313) and those that are defined with reference to the beginning of such period only (14\u201316). The former are assigned not only to loanwords but also to calques from a given L2. The latter subtype of contact-related age categories is only relevant for past L2s; they are assigned to lexemes that are based on loanwords from a given L2 or that contain derivational markers from that L2. Certain arbitrary decisions had to be taken with regard to the assignment of lexemes to concrete L2s (e.g. a loanword that may originate in Slovak or Czech, has been assigned to the age category SLOVAK; see also Chapter).\n\nNO.\tAGE CATEGORY\tFROM\t     TO\n1\tProto-Indo-European\t4500 BCE\t3000 BCE\n2\tProto-Indo-Iranian\t2500 BCE\t2000 BCE\n3\tOld Indo-Aryan\t1900 BCE\t500 BCE\n4\tMiddle Indo-Aryan\t500 BCE\t700 CE\n5\tEarly Romani\t900 CE\t1300 CE\n6\tlater than Early Romani\t1300 CE\t2007 CE\n7\tWest Asian L2\t700 CE\t1000 CE\n8\tGreek L2\t900 CE\t1300 CE\n9\tSouth Slavic L2\t1300 CE\t1750 CE\n10\tHungarian L2\t1650 CE\t2007 CE\n11\tVlax presence\t1850 CE\t2007 CE\n12\tSlovak L2\t1920 CE\t2007 CE\n13\tCzech L2\t1950 CE\t2007 CE\n14\tWest Asian L2 or later\t700 CE\t2007 CE\n15\tGreek L2 or later\t900 CE\t2007 CE\n16\tSouth Slavic L2 or later\t1300 CE\t2007 CE\n\nThe dates of the age categories are generally very approximate (see the book chapter for discussion).

Especially with phrasal forms but also elsewhere, the field may contains information on syntactic construction.

Unfortunately, some layers of traditional Ket vocabulary, notably for emotions and human interaction and especially for anything having to do with love or sex, appear to have gone unrecorded. I logically suspect there were native Ket words for some of these items, so that the Russian loan represents a replacement. However, since this is my conjecture based on common sense rather than linguistic data, I list 'no information' in such cases.

Infinitive forms historically contained an affix, but in the modern language this affix often has fused to the original root, creating a syllabic tone.

There are relativesly few derivational affixes in Ket.\n\nAnalyzable compound\n\nThis is by far the largest category of polymorphemic Ket words. In many cases, a root compound also includes the nominalizing suffix /s/. In instances where the root compound does not normally appear without this /s/ I have marked as 'compound', while instances where an independent compound takes /s/ to make a new word I have listed as 'derived'.\n\nAnalyzable phrasal\n\nOccasionally, the Ket use a phrase \u2013 usually adjectival modifier plus noun \u2013 to express the given meaning. I have included those instances where the meaning is expressed by a set phrase, such as q\u0259laj \u016bl 'bitter water', for 'coffee'.

Nearly all of the latter derive from \nRussian. There were a number of instances where a clearly borrowed Russian root was compounded with one or more Native Ket roots, such as qonokssajdo 'to have breakfast' (from Ket qonoks 'morning' + Russian c\u030caj 'tea' + Ket do 'drink'). These are listed as 'clearly borrowed, with only the Russian root discussed in the lower sections of the origins of the loan.\n\nThere were only a few instances where words may have come from other Inner Asian languages, notable Turko-Mongol q\u0101n 'khan', and possible Iranic na'n 'bread'.  There are quite a number of identifiable Selkup (Samoyedic) borrowings, but these mostly involve specialized reindeer vocabulary and most didn't fall into the basic words included in the database. Other than Selkup and Russian, identifiable loans from other languages are few and far between. It is possible that Ket contains loans from other Siberian languages that are completely extinct, but these, unfortunately, are unrecoverable.  Much of the very basic vocabulary appears to have clear cognates in Athabaskan-Eyak-Tlingit, suggesting that even many words represented only in Ket are derivative of the Yeniseic proto-language. However, I ignored this in the Age field, given the still hypothetical nature of my \""Dene-Yeniseic\"" work, and so I listed the origin of words without clear cognates in other Yeniseic languages as \""no information\"" rather than \""from the proto-language\"".\n\nKet is a language that tends to resist borrowing, preferring to coin its own neologisms instead when new items enter the Ket consciousness. One of my favorites is \u0113\u0263 suul 'iron snowsled', for 'car'. My Ket informants, who were Russian-Ket bilinguals, tended to reject most obvious Russian words, even for new realia.  I think that this Native Ket linguistic conservatism makes the language interesting to include in a study of loanword typology.

This holds especially for \u201cProto-Turkic\u201d, for which no observed data exists, and the age of which is debated. For Evenki copies we assume that they took place after the 13th/14th century, but we do not know when Sakha may have stopped copying words from the indigenous languages."", ""fd_borrowed"": ""1. Very little evidence for copying: \n\nWe classified items into this category in three cases: a) When the word did not have a Turkic etymology and thus did not appear to have been inherited, but when we were unable to find a model for it; these words may therefore actually represent innovations in Sakha. b) When competing opinions have been voiced in the literature as to the copied vs. non-copied status of the word. c) When the word did not have a Turkic etymology, and the putative model words (from a formal point of view) differ so greatly in meaning that it is hard to make a case for copying.\n\n2. Perhaps copied: \n\nWe classified items into this category in the following cases: a) When the overlap in meanings between the proposed model and the copy was rather tenuous, requiring convoluted explanations. b) When the formal match was not good, but when copying had been proposed by others. c) Items that could either have been derived in Sakha from copied words (in which case they would have been classified as \u2018no evidence for copying\u2019), or that could have been copied as a whole (in which case they would have been classified as \u2018probably\u2019 or \u2018clearly copied\u2019). d) Items where the phonology indicates that they may have been copied, e.g. words beginning with a s- in Sakha that have Turkic cognates also beginning with an s-. Since Turkic word-initial s- has been lost in Sakha, the retention of s- is indicative of a late copy from some Turkic language. \n\n3. Probably copied: \n\nIn this category we classified words that have been suggested as copies and the phonology of which are also indicative of copying, but where the formal and semantic overlap with the model word is not perfect. We also classified words in this category that have been suggested as ancient copies into Proto-Turkic, or that seem to be copied from Ket and Selkup, where nothing is really known about the contact situation.\n\n4. Clearly copied: \n\nWords that are clearly copied with a good formal and semantic match to the model language. \n\nNote: When the only \u2018derivation\u2019 that had taken place on copied verbs was the addition of the causative suffix (to make the verb transitive) these were classified as \u2018clearly copied\u2019, even though in general derived forms were classified as not having been copied. The reason is that in these cases the causative suffix does not effect a change in meaning (i.e. these are not \u2018real\u2019 causatives), only in the syntactic valency of the verb."", ""abbreviations"": ""AGNR\t\tagent nominalizer\nDIM\t\tdiminutive\nE\t\tepenthetic vowel\nEMPH\t\temphatic\nHAB\t\thabitual\nMULT\t\tmultiplicative\nORD\t\tordinal\nPART\t\tpartitive\nPROP\t\tproprietive\nPTL\t\tparticle\nVR\t\tverbalizer""}",19,Sakha,,,,1
21,"{""fd_calqued"": ""As for a working definition, the following guidelines were used:\n\u2014\ta true calque is a loan translation, with all components being translated from another language\n\u2014\ta calque in a less strict sense is a \u201cloan rendition\u201d, (in the case of a compound consisting of two elements), with one component being translated from another language and the other element with a semantically similar term, e.g. German Wolkenkratzer after English skyscraper. \n\u2014\tnot a calque: a \u201cloan formation\u201d (Lehnsch\u00f6pfung), which means a term whose coinage was due to external influence.\n\nBoth loan translations and loan renditions were classified as calques, but it was mentioned in \u201ccomments on borrowed\u201d W10 what class they fall into. \nThe working hypothesis was that any NJ words that could potentially be calques, would be based on Western languages, mostly of the Meiji modernization era, but some of the terms also from the 15/16th century onwards when Japan came into contact with the West.\n\nAs for Meiji modernization era vocabulary,\n-\tif a word can reliably, by way of references, shown to be based on a Western item, 4 if it is a true calque and 3 if it is a loan translation (also record the distinction between those in the field \u201ccreated on loan basis\u201d.)\n-\tif a word is a true neologism, not based on a classic Chinese term, but no further references can be found, 3 if it is a true calque and 2 if it is a loan translation\n \n\nSome potentially problematic cases were classified as follows:\n \n-\tIn some cases a NJ term is reanalyzed as a SJ one. For example, the NJ term kaerigoto \u8fd4\u4e8b \u201canswer\u201d was reanalyzed as a SJ term henji. Cases like this were classified as a calque. \n-\tAnother tricky issue involves the case of potential NJ calques modeled after Chinese words. If a Chinese word exists with the same characters, a \u201c1\u201d was given, a \u201c2\u201d if the resulting NJ structure runs counter to the structure encountered in other NJ words (for instance, Chinese compounds usually exhibit a VO structure, while NJ compounds usually follow a OV pattern).\n-\tAnother problem for NJ vocabulary is the question what to do with words that are likely calques in Chinese that were then borrowed into Japanese, e.g. by\u014din \u75c5\u9662 \u201chospital\u201d which is said to have been coined after a Dutch word. These cases have not been marked as calques."", ""fd_lexical_stratum"": ""It is a well known and oft-described fact in descriptions of Japanese that the Japanese lexicon is stratified (e.g. Shibatani 1990). \n\nMainly five different strata are distinguished in Modern Japanese:\n\u27a2\tNative vocabulary (NJ) \u548c\u8a9e: in Japanese this is either called wago \u2018Japanese words\u2019, or Yamato kotoba \u2018Yamato kotoba\u2019 after the first Japanese kingdom established in the 4th century CE. This refers to the native vocabulary that is considered not to have been borrowed from any other language. \n\u27a2\tMimetic vocabulary \u64ec\u97f3\u8a9e: there is a number of onomatopoetic words in Japanese, which are usually divided in three categories: giongo \u2018sound-mimicking words\u2019, giseigo \u2018voice-mimicking words\u2019 and gitaigo \u2018mode-mimicking words\u2019, but as the distinctions are notoriously difficult to draw (Hamano 1998:6), I have only used giongo in the database. Only words that follow the patterns as described in Hamano 1996 are recorded as mimetic words here; other words that contain mimetic elements are marked accordingly in Custom Field 2.\n\u27a2\tSino-Japanese vocabulary (SJ) \u6f22\u8a9e: called kango in Japanese or \u2018Han words\u2019, there was a massive influx of Chinese vocabulary into the Japanese language from the time Japan made contact with the Chinese civilisation via Korea beginning from the 5th century A.D. onwards. By the time of the first written records from the Japanese archipelago the Chinese language had already firmly established its place among the Japanese elite, who had become bilingual in Chinese and Japanese. Even after bilingualism declined, Chinese remained the language of administration.\n\u27a2\tNon-Chinese foreign vocabulary (F) \u5916\u6765\u8a9e: called gairaigo in Japanese, \u2018words that came from outside (of Japan)\u2019, refer to borrowings that have been taken from languages other than Chinese since the exposure to the West in the 16th century.\n\u27a2\tHybrid vocabulary (H) \u6df7\u7a2e\u8a9e: known as konshugo \u2018mixed words\u2019 in Japanese, there are also some lexemes that consist of morphemes of different strata.\n\nSome group the native vocabulary and the mimetic vocabulary together. They may be both of native origin, but they follow different phonological, morphosyntactic and graphematic rules (Vance 1987:140-152, Ito and Mester 1996, Irwin 2005, and also the remarks on the script in the annotation to the Original script field).\nIt is important note that the above mentioned strata correspond to the intuitions of contemporary native speakers and do not necessarily reflect the true origins of the words concerned. Some words will be perceived as Native Japanese although they might have been borrowed in times prehistorical, and Sino-Japanese words will be perceived such regardless of the individual word history, i.e. whether the word in question was borrowed from Chinese, coined in Japan or somesuch (Ota 2004, Irwin 2005).\n\nIn parentheses, there are sometimes comments on the different strata, chiefly in the following situations:\n\u27a2\tWords that have an onomatopoetic component but do not follow the patterns for mimetic words (cf. Hamano 1998) are marked as such in this field.\n\u27a2\tSome Chinese characters can have several SJ readings, which are called on\u2019yomi. There are two types, go\u2019on (\u201cW\u00fa sounds\u201c) and kan\u2019on (\u201cH\u00e0n sounds\u201d) on the one hand and t\u014d\u2019on (\u201cT\u00e1ng sounds\u201d) and s\u014d\u2019on (\u201cS\u00f2ng sounds\u201d) on the other. The former refer to the pronunciation of SJ terms that were borrowed during the period of Japanese-Chinese bilingualism of the Japanese elite, the pronunciation of which became frozen after the decline of said bilingualism. So even if a SJ word was borrowed after the decline of bilingualism, if it was through writing, the pronunciation would be either go\u2019on or kan\u2019on.The latter reflects the pronunciation of SJ words that were borrowed after the decline of bilingualism not through writing but due to oral communication (\u201coral loans\u201d). In the case of t\u014d\u2019on and s\u014d\u2019on, there are no clear-cut distinctions between them, sometimes even the designation  s\u014dt\u014d\u2019on is found. As far as go\u2019on and kan\u2019on go, they are clearly differentiated (even if in some cases the forms are homonymous), but they were for the most part not included in this field. For more information cf. Miller (1967:102-112), for a more detailed account Yamada (1940); also for a character dictionary Morohashi (1955).\n\u27a2\tThere is another category of on\u2019yomi, that refers to the case where a character has changed its SJ reading due to a mistake or an unexpected sound change: kan\u2019y\u014don \u6163\u7528\u97f3 \u2018idiomatic reading\u2019 (Miller 1967:106). If this occurred in a word, it was marked as such. This does not include cases"", ""fd_borrowed"": ""The point of departure here is the stratification of the Japanese lexicon. The values are as follows: \n\n0.\tno evidence for borrowing\n1.\tVery little evidence for borrowing\n2.\tperhaps borrowed\n3.\tprobably borrowed\n4.\tclearly borrowed\n\nNative Japanese (NJ) stratum\n\nNJ words are by default presumed to be 0. Dictionaries provide excellence resources for almost all words that entered the language after writing was adopted in Japan. The only problem lies with words that have been present in the language since the earliest records. There have been several attempts to link some of the NJ stratum to various languages:\n\n\u2014 Chinese: Karlgren 1926 offered a list of 23 Japanese words that might be borrowings from Chinese. He suggested that these might be comparable to \""Lehnw\u00f6rter\"" which is a term that designates words that have been borrowed into the German language but integrated phonologically in such a way that they are no longer recognizable as loans. Likewise, these early loans in Japanese would be integrated in the NJ lexicon to such an extent that they would not be recognizable as Chinese loans, which would be the case with the much larger SJ vocabulary. In Karlgren\u2019s view, these early loans could provide additional hints for the phonology of Archaic Chinese as they were borrowed well before the Middle Chinese period. Altogether, there is a list of about 29 forms that are said to be borrowed from Archaic Chinese. Except for three or four, on which the academic community seems to widely agree, the validity of most of these remain somewhat controversial, as in Kamei 1954, which is largely a rebuttal to Karlgren 1926, but since they represent probable loan scenarios both in terms of phonology, semantics and cultural context, they are assigned an 3. Miyake X has reviewed the list of loans proposed by Karlgren. If Miyake finds a particular word to be an \u201cinvalid\u201d example of a loan (grade F in the study), then a 2 is assigned. If Miyake argues against the word being a loan (grade C in the study), a 2 is only assigned if there are compounding factors such as semantic likelihood of the term being borrowed.\n\n\u2014 Austronesian: said to be a substratum of Japanese and as such could be source for borrowings. While Shinmura 1908 is probably the earliest proponent of an Austronesian substrate theory, Polivanov 1918 offers a first systematic proposal. He notes a number of phonological and morphological characteristics that set Japanese apart from Korean and other languages usually said to be genetically related to Japanese, which he ascribes to an Austronesian influence on Japanese, as for instance the presence of some prefixes and the fact that open syllables are typical. They found a supporter in Izui 1953 who proposed a list of sound correspondences extending to about 55 Proto-Malayo-Polynesian (PMP) based on the reconstruction in Dempwolff (1934-8). A more recent account of potential loans from Old Javanese, in Kumar and Rose 2000, has not been considered for this paper, as they do not employ proto-forms available but Old Javanese, which would reflect a time depth of roughly 2000 years, which would make the case for contact even less probable. Most sound correspondences are quite plausible, even though the fact that both Japanese and PMP have simple phonotactics compound the problem. Similarly, most of the semantic relations are also plausible, however the biggest remaining problem is the fact that first, no particular cultural domain can be associated with the allegedly Austronesian words and that second, even though there might be genetic evidence (Kumar and Rose 2000), there is no clear archaeological record that points to contact between the Malayo-Polynesian world and Japan (Peter Bellwood, p.c.). Thus, I assign these words a 1.\n\n\u2014 Korean: Martin 1966 links 330 words of NJ to Korean. The vast majority, 243 out of 256, occur in either Old Japanese or Late Old Japanese. Thus, if the Japanese-Korean hypothesis holds, there would be a good chance that these words would be part of the inherited lexicon, so that it would not affect the borrowing scale here. However, I  have annotated the entries where applicable. There are a number of items disputed to be borrowings from Korean, which are usually doubted by Japanese scholars. They are assigned either a  2 or 3, depending on how much support a theory has.\n\nSino-Japanese (SJ) stratum\n\nThe SJ stratum mainly consists of borrowings from Chinese, however there are some exceptions:\n\n\u2014\tso-called ateji, where Chinese characters have only been used for their phonetic value. The most important example of this in the database is kega \u201cwound\u201d written with the characters for \u201cblame (v), suspicious\u201d and \u201cI\u201d, ultimately a NJ word written in a SJ manner.\n\u2014\twhere a NJ term is reanalyzed as a SJ term. For example, the NJ term kaerigoto \u8fd4\u4e8b \u201canswer\u201d was reanalysed as a SJ term henji, which is treated as a calque and hence as 0.\n\u2014\tthere are a number of SJ terms that are likely to be Japanese neologism. Roughly, two groups should be differentiated: neologisms created before the Meiji era modernization of the second half of the 19th century and neologisms created before that. It is usually acknowledged that during the modernization of the 19th century in East Asia, Japanese took some kind of pioneering role and thus created a lot of neologism that later spread on to Korean and Chinese. For the time before the Meiji Modernization, it is somewhat more unlikely that a term was coined in Japan and spread on to Chinese and Korean, which means that a neologism from this era should ideally be unique to Japanese. \n   o\tMeiji modernisms are classified as 0 if a reputable source can be found to attest for its status as a Japanese neologism (e.g. notation in Morohashi as a Japanese coinage). However if there is disagreement in several sources, they are classified as 1 or 2 depending on the credibility of said sources\n   o\tIt is classified as 1 if the term in question does not have currency in Mandarin (having no currency means here that it is not recorded in any of the big Chinese dictionaries and that Google hits of Chinese websites mainly point to a Japanese context) and if it belongs to a semantic domain typically associated with modernisation after the model of the West, e.g. Western style military, technology, Western social concepts. \n   o\tIt is classified as 2 if the term in question does not have currency in Mandarin, but does not particularly belong to the domain of modernization. Some other criteria used are \n     -\tits absence in old texts (this can be a tricky criterion and sometimes only be proven by omission, i.e. if dictionaries that usually cite classical Chinese texts as sources do not mention such sources for the word in question\n     -\tif it is fairly frequent in Japanese but rare in Chinese\n   o\tIt is classified as 3 if a source can be found in both Japanese and Chinese, even if there is a semantic divergence, but nevertheless seems to be absent from classical texts. This still might not rule out a coinage in Japan and subsequent borrowing into Chinese.\n   o\tIt is classified as 4 if sources point towards a Chinese coinage, or there are precursors of this in ancient texts (for example, if a word first appears in the modernization era in a Japanese text, but nevertheless was already used in a classical Chinese text)\n\u2014\tfor those Japanese SJ words from the pre-modernization period, the following rules apply:\n   o\tif a word is clearly referenced to be a Japanese coinage, it is accorded a 0. A 1 or 2 if sources are conflicting each other.\n   o\tIf a word is not in currency in Mandarin, it is accorded a 3\n   o\tA 4 in all other cases. The basic guideline for pre-modernization SJ words is that the default assumption will be borrowing from Chinese rather than coinage within Japanese.\n\nForeign stratum\n\nAs for the Foreign stratum, the individual word etymologies are usually quite well-documented so that the assignment of either 0 (Japanese coinage) or 4 (borrowing) should be relatively straightforward."", ""fd_gloss"": ""Except for words marked as unanalyzable, and some marked as semi-analyzable, morpheme-by-morpheme glosses have been provided for all entries.

Jacobsen 1996), this verb is usually marked as Semi-analyzable in the Analyzability field with no further analysis. The counterpart verb is then given in this field."", ""fd_comment_on_borrowed"": ""This field has been used for the following purposes:\n\n\u2014\tFor SJ terms that were attested in annotated Chinese text. From the beginning of record keeping until the dawn of the Modern Period, the majority of administrative, religious and academic works was written in Chinese (kanbun). However, concomitant with the decline of linguistic competence in Chinese, texts were increasingly read in a peculiar mixed style called hentai-kanbun, which made it possible to read out a Chinese text in Japanese by means of adding Japanese desinences and particles as diacritic signs and transforming the Chinese word order into a Japanese one by means of reversal and return marks. For an English language introduction, see Crawcour 1965. If the Nippon Kokugo Daijiten gave such a text as earliest reference, it was used for the Age field, since such a text was intended to be read as Japanese and hence it could be argued that said word at this point had entered the Japanese language. Furthermore, not in all cases was the earliest reference for a \u201cpure\u201d Japanese text (wabun) also given. Nevertheless, in all cases the date of the wabun reference was entered here.\n\u2014\tFor SJ terms that are controversial, especially from the Meiji Modernization, it has been noted whether these terms in questions are likely to be neologisms or calques. For disputedly borrowed NJ terms, no specific mention has been made in this field, but cf. the remarks in the annotation to the Borrowed field.\n\u2014\tAny word marked as calque was also commented upon in this field. Cf. also remarks below on calques in the annotation to the Calqued field .\n\u2014\tAlso, information on when an entity the term is referring to is thought to have been brought to Japan is recorded in this field.\n\u2014\tThis field has also been used for additional remarks that would not fit anywhere else. For instance, synonyms for native words were recorded here (whereas for borrowed words, synonyms were usually entered in the field Other comments)."", ""fd_form"": ""In most cases, the aim is for the most basic and readily understood Japanese words to be entered into the database. Overly formal or colloquial words are used when otherwise only circumlocutions are available, which are only included when they constitute set phrases. Somewhat formal words that are prevalent in writing are also used, usually alongside words more common in spoken language.\n\nThe word forms are cited in the standard Hepburn transcription, with vowel lengths dinstinguished by way of the macron, with the exception of /i:/ which is doubled as <ii>. The pitch accent is usually not marked, with the exception of where it might be relevant for instances of apparent homophony."", ""fd_comment_on_word_form"": ""This field is used for the following purposes:\n\n1.\tWhenever a word underwent a noteworthy phonological or morphological change, this is noted here. Regular sound change leading to forms in Modern Japanese different from older stages of Japanese are usually not recorded throughout the database.\n2.\tVariants are also recorded in this field. These are usually limited to words sharing the same lexical material. Phrases and compounds that are also commonly used are noted in the Meaning field, and in case of loanwords synonyms are discussed in the Other Comments field.\n3.\tAlso, in cases of apparent homophony in Native words, the locus of the pitch-accent is noted. For instance, awa \u2018foam\u2019 and awa \u2018millet\u2019 can be ruled out as an instance of polysemy since the former has the accent on the second mora and the latter on the first.\n4.\tWhen a word is written according to the principle of ateji, i.e. Chinese characters used according to their pronunciation, not their meaning, this is recorded here, and also if the ateji writing is still being used."", ""fd_integration"": ""This has been seen in direct correlation to what stratum a word belongs to.

Bulletin of the School of Oriental \tstudies VI. [cited in Kamei, with no further details]"", ""fd_original_script"": ""The word forms are cited in the Japanese script. Japanese employs a mixture of three scripts, two syllabaries and a logographic script:\n\t\n(1) Kanji: this is the logographic script borrowed from Chinese. It is used for most full words: nouns, personal pronouns and the unchanging part of verbs and adjectives, of both the Native Japanese and Sino-Japanese strata. Whereas with words from the Sino-Japanese stratum each character reflects a monosyllabic Chinese pronunciation (called on\u2019yomi \u2018sound reading\u2019 in Japanese), Native words are usually assigned completely to a Chinese character based on the meaning of the Chinese character, seldom multi-character comibinations (such as ky\u014d \u2018today\u2019 which is assigned to a multi-character combination \u4eca\u65e5 meaning \u2018today\u2019 in Chinese). This way of pronouncing the kanji like Native words is called kun\u2019yomi \u2018meaning reading\u2019. This was also done for words of Foreign origin. Also, some words of Native Japanese origin that are distinguished in writing but can reasonably be classified to be instances of polysemy rather than homophony. In these cases, each instance is entered into W3 together with a meaning description. \nThere is the phenomenon of ateji (\u2018directed characters\u2019, cf. Tajima 1998:452-461), where Chinese characters are applied to words that are not Sino-Japanese not according to their meaning but according to the sound. For instance, kega \u602a\u6211 \u2018wound\u2019 is a Native word, yet the Chinese characters, meaning \u201csuspicious\u201d and \u201cself\u201d respectively, do not reflect the meaning of the word, but rather were chosen only for their pronunciation. There are a few instances of this throughout the database, which have all been marked as such in W3. Earlier, ateji were also used for words of Foreign origin, which has also been included where applicable.  \nThe Ministry of Education prescribes a set of 1,945 characters to be taught in schools. After the Second World War, the characters underwent a series of mild reforms, which applied to the prescribed set only and was of much smaller scale than the efforts undertaken in China. I have followed this and have not noted the traditional forms in cases where the characters have been reformed.\n\n(2) Hiragana: this script was orginally developed from the cursive writing style of Chinese calligraphy and was first used in diaries and novels that were written in the Japanese vernacular as opposed to the more formal writing which was done in Chinese. The script is currently used for most function words (with the most important exception being personal pronouns) and verb and adjective desinences. In the latter case, there are sometimes several possible variants, of which only one is included in the database. For instance, azukaru \u2018keep\u2019 can be both written \u9810\u304b\u308b and \u9810\u308b. Hiragana is also used in cases where a word originally written in kanji has grammaticalized into a function word (for instance miru as a full verb means \u2018see\u2019 and is written \u898b\u308b, while as an aspectual auxiliary expressing the conative aspect, it is written completely in hiragana as \u307f\u308b). Hiragana is also used for any word of either Native Japanese or Sino-Japanese stratum that is written with characters outside of the set prescribed by the Ministry of Education. However, I have usually tried to always give the kanji spelling for lexical words if applicable.\n\n(3) Katakana: this script was originally developed from shorthand renderings of Chinese characters and used in conjunction with Chinese characters as a reading aid. The script is now used to write any foreign names that are not part of the Sinosphere and foreign loanwords (these include all words from languages other than Chinese and Chinese loanwords that were borrowed after the 19th century. As mentioned above, some Foreign words used to be written in kanji as well, but this has ceased, and where applicable the kanji spelling has been included alongside the primary katakana one. For instance, buriki \u2018tinplate\u2019 used to have two kanji spellings:  \u933b\u529b, which is a case of ateji, and\u9244\u8449, which is a case of semantically-based kanji assignment (characters meaning \u2018steel\u2019 and \u2018leaf\u2019); both have been discarded today in favour of the katakana spelling \u30d6\u30ea\u30ad. \nKatakana are also used for animal names in a scientific context, even in cases where kanji are available. However, in cases like these I have chosen the kanji whenever possible.\n\nThe so-called mimetic words are usually written in hiragana, but sometimes in katakana for emphasis. For more discussion of the different scripts and the development of their modern usage, cf. Hayashi (1982) and Gottlieb (1995:ch.1).\n\nSometimes, the words are written in different characters but where it can be argued that these constitute cases of polysemy (since Japanese also employs Chinese characters to write Native Japanese words, this sometimes leads to semantic distinctions made in Chinese superimposed on Native Japanese items, for instance, the verb miru \u201csee\u201d can be written with 4 or 5 different Chinese characters). Thus we have tobu  \u8df3\u3076  \u201cjump\u201d and tobu \u98db\u3076 fly\u201d, and fune \u821f \u201cboat\u201d and fune \u8239  \u201cship\u201d. In cases like that, I have included all the relevant variants in this field, as I regard the differences in writing to be secondary."", ""fd_loan_history"": ""If a loanword was by itself a loanword from a different language, the earliest form, for which written records were available, was entered. Thus, in a case like oriibu, which came from the English olive, the Greek word elaion was entered into this field, while the \""Loan history\"" field reflects the fact that the word was borrowed into Latin from the Greek, and then was borrowed from the Old French into the English language. \n\nSome loanwords from Chinese were in turn calques from Sanskrit. In such a case, the information concerning the original Sanskrit term which was the source of the calque was entered into the \""earlier source word\"" fields, with the \""Loan history\"" field reflecting the status as a calque.\n\nIf a word is considered to be a loan translation of some sort, then the information concerning the assumed source word for the translation was entered into the \""earlier source word\"" fields, with the \""Loan history\"" field indicating the loan translation assumption."", ""fd_contact_situation"": ""For Japanese, Loveday 1996 has attempted to provide a comprehensive scenario of contact which I am planning to adopt. I will try to adapt this model to the model proposed by you. \nLoveday (1996:28) proposes the following periods:\n\u2022\tNara/Heian (8th \u2013 12 th century), Donor language Chinese (Sanskrit). Culturally motivated through Buddhism and Confucianism.\no\tPolitical dominance: 1 (the relationship between China and Japan was one of suzerainty)\no\tCultural dominance: 3. The incipient Chinese influence on Japan transforms its society in such a profound way that cannot be understated.\no\tNumerical dominance: 2-3. It is surmised that the population of China in these days exceeded that of Japan by far. However, contact was only indirect.\no\tVariety of social contact situations: 1. Towards the beginning of the period, the young members of the ruling class were sent to China to study its language and culture, and there were also delegations sent to the court in regular intervals. Some monks and other scholars also travelled to Japan. Other than that, the variety of social contact situations was virtually nonexistent.\no\tNumber of R bilinguals: 1. The number of bilinguals was always limited to the elite.\no\tSocial status of R bilinguals: 3. As bilingualism was limited to the elite, the social status was very high.\no\tDuration of contact: 3. It is estimated that the contact to China started at least in the 4th century CE and has lasted until today.\no\tWritten language used by used by R speakers: 2.  While some private correspondence and poetry was composed in Japanese, the overwhelming majority of writing was done in Chinese. Towards the end of the period, major works of fiction were written in Japanese, however, the dominance of Chinese (which towards the end of the period had largely lost its status as a spoken language and was thus mainly limited to the written medium) in all other offical areas continued. Literacy outside of the elite was extremely low.\no\tLanguage of religion of most R speakers: 0. The vast majority of the people followed Shintoism, a religion exclusively conducted in Japanese (even the prayers by the Emperor from the 8th century are in Japanese). Buddhism was practiced in Chinese, however it was largely limited to the elite.\n\u2022\tLate 16th \u2013 early 17th century, Donor languages Portuguese, Spanish Latin. Culturally motivated through Christianity.\no\tPolitical dominance: 0-1. Portugal and Spain established trade with Japan and never had any political sway over the country. However the transmission of Christianity and the superior European weaponry had some impact on domestic developments in Japan. Also security concerns as to the true intentions of the Catholic merchants and missionaries led to the total banishment of the Portuguese and Spanish from Japan at the beginning of the Edo period.\no\tCultural dominance: 1. Given the impact of European firearms and Christianity (again chiefly in raising security concerns, as it was feared by the government that proselytising the farmers might make them more rebellious), some degree of cultural influence might be called for. (However, this depends on the exact definition of cultural dominance).\no\tNumerical dominance: -3. The number of Portuguese and Spaniards in Japan was exceedingly low compared to the general population. This number will be different if seen from a global scale.\no\tVariety of social contact situations: 2. Since this was the period of internal strife (also called \u201cWarring States\u201d), the movement of foreigners inside the country was relatively unchecked. Thus, there was proselytising done by missonaries, there were foreign merchants trading and some extent of other foreign professionals such as government officials or doctors.\no\tNumber of R bilinguals: 1. The number of bilinguals is deemed to be very low. The missionaries had to learn Japanese in order to translate the Bible and to communicate with their parishioners, the merchants needed to communicate with their trading partners. In this process some Japanese acquired the language of the foreigners, acting as translators. Since Japanese nationals were still free to leave their country and come back, there were also Japanese nationals who had learnt foreign languages while abroad.\no\tSocial status of R bilinguals: 1. The elite was clearly not fluent in Spanish or Portuguese. The status of Japanese translators was clearly that of lowly government officials.\no\tDuration of contact: 2. The time of contact was around 100 years, from the first arrival of an European missionary on Japanese soil until the expulsion of all Catholics from Japan..\no\tWritten language used by used by R speakers: 0.  At this point, the Japanese had developed a peculiar form of split diglossia: in writing, there were two distinct codes, one based on Classical Japanese, and the other based on Classical Chinese, with numerous intermediate styles. One was used more for administrative purposes, while the other was used for fiction. On the other hand, the spoken language was not written at all.\no\tLanguage of religion of most R speakers: 0. Although Buddhism had diffused all realms of society by then, most speakers would still use Japanese. Christianity was also taught in Japanese, however, the overall number of Christians in Japan remained comparatively low.\n\u2022\tEdo (17th \u2013 19th century), Donor language Dutch. Culturally motivated through early Western science.\no\tPolitical dominance: 0. The relationship between the Netherlands and Japan was strictly one of trade.\no\tCultural dominance: 1. Only to the extent that the Dutch were responsible for bringing early Western science, mainly in the realm of medicine, to Japan.\no\tNumerical dominance: -3. The number of Dutch in Japan was exceedingly low compared to the general population. This number will be different if seen from a global scale.\no\tVariety of social contact situations: 0. This was the era of Japanese isolation. The Dutch were confined to a little artificial island in Nagasaki harbour, and were allowed to send a delegation to the Shogun in Edo once a year.\no\tNumber of R bilinguals: 1. The government had designated translators who were allowed to interact with the Dutch and learn their language.\no\tSocial status of R bilinguals: 1. The elite was clearly not fluent in Dutch. The status of Japanese translators was clearly that of lowly government officials.\no\tDuration of contact: 3. The contact lasted around 250 years, until the country was \u201copened up\u201d by the Americans. Contact with the Netherlands continued afterwards, but not on such prominent a scale.\no\tWritten language used by used by R speakers: 0.  The peculiar form of split diglossia described above still persists. However, in the Edo period, literacy amongst the common people increases leading to the development of mass literature written in the vernacular.\no\tLanguage of religion of most R speakers: 0. Religion was still almost exclusively conducted in Japanese.\n\u2022\tMeiji (1868-1912), Donor languages English, German, French. Culturally motivated through general Western culture.\no\tPolitical dominance: 1-2. Concomitant with \u201copening up the country\u201d, the Great European powers impose so-called \u201cunequal treaties\u201d upon Japan. Japan was the first of the East Asian countries to have those treaties annulled, but only after its rapid modernisation and militarisation, towards the mid-1890s.\no\tCultural dominance: 2-3. This is a period where Japan opens up to the West to make good on the advances in science and technology that had passed by Japan during its long period of isolation. Again, young members of the elite are sent abroad to study the Western culture, instigating a wide variety of sweeping reforms after their return.\no\tNumerical dominance: -3. The number of Westerners in Japan was exceedingly low compared to the general population. This number will be different if seen from a global scale.\no\tVariety of social contact situations: 2-3. Since the country had become \u201copen\u201d, the range of social contact situations ran the whole gamut. However, it can be surmised that the number of intercultural marriages was quite low, although not completely unexistent (the most prominent example being the Anglo-Greek author Lafcadio Hearn).\no\tNumber of R bilinguals: 1. While there were more Japanese fluent in Western languages than before, their overall number was still quite low compared to the whole population.\no\tSocial status of R bilinguals: 3. As this time the elite was once again the part of the population learning the D languages, their status was higher than in preceding eras.\no\tDuration of contact: 2. The contact started in the mid-19th century, and continues to this day. However, since WWII, English has been the langauge with the predominant influence.\no\tWritten language used by used by R speakers: 0.  The form of split diglossia ended in this period, and a movement to establish the spoken Japanese language as written medium was largely successful. Some remnants of a mixed Classical Japanese-Classical Chinese style persisted in some official documents.\no\tLanguage of religion of most R speakers: 0. Religion was still almost exclusively conducted in Japanese.\n\u2022\tPre-Second World War (1912-1940), Donor languages English, German, French. Culturally motivated through Mass Western culture.\no\tPolitical dominance: 0. With the rise of Japan as a military power, the political dominance of the West on Japan declines, eventually culminating in war.\no\tCultural dominance: 2. This is arguably a period where a rising sense of nationalism leads to a decline of the cultural influence of the West on Japan. Japanese nationalist ideologies are developed envisioning East Asia dominated by a Japan free of Western influences. However, at the same time, the appeal of Western mass culture is also rising in Japan, especially from the United States.\no\tNumerical dominance: -3. The number of Westerners in Japan was exceedingly low compared to the general population. This number will be different if seen from a global scale.\no\tVariety of social contact situations: 2. It can be argued that with the growing influence of Japanese nationalism, the variety of contact situations decreased as well.\no\tNumber of R bilinguals: 1. The overall number of bilingual Japanese was still quite low compared to the whole population.\no\tSocial status of R bilinguals: 2-3. As this time the elite was once again the part of the population learning the D languages, their status was higher than in preceding eras. Again, their status might be decreasing to the extent that a new nationalist generation of leaders was growing up without the knowledge of a foreign language.\no\tDuration of contact: 2. The contact started in the mid-19th century, and continues to this day. However, since WWII, English has been the langauge with the predominant influence.\no\tWritten language used by used by R speakers: 0.  The form of split diglossia ended in this period, and a movement to establish the spoken Japanese language as written medium was largely successful. Some remnants of a mixed Classical Japanese-Classical Chinese style persisted in some official documents.\no\tLanguage of religion of most R speakers: 0. Religion was still almost exclusively conducted in Japanese.\n\u2022\tPresent day, mainly English, other languages. Culturally motivated through international culture.\no\tPolitical dominance: 2-3. After the war, the dominance of Japan was total because of the occupation by the American forces. Gradually, Japan has become more independent, although it remains a staunch ally of the United States to this day. \no\tCultural dominance: 2-3. American culture has increased its influence since the end of the war. At the same time, the trend of globalisation has exposed Japan to the outside world (mainly Western) to an unprecedented degree.\no\tNumerical dominance: -3. The number of Westerners in Japan is still exceedingly low compared to the general population. This number will be different if seen from a global scale.\no\tVariety of social contact situations: 3. In this globalised world, the variety of social contact situations is very broad. A large number of Japanese reside outside of the country, and a large number of foreigners do in Japan (although still not to a degree that would warrant a \u20132 instead of \u20133). There is a great number of binational marriages.\no\tNumber of R bilinguals: 2. English is taught widely in school, although most Japanese never reach a high level of proficiency.\no\tSocial status of R bilinguals: 2. While proficiency in a foreign language is regarded as something worthwhile, it is not necessary for a member of the elite to be bilingual. \no\tDuration of contact: 2. The contact started in the mid-19th century, and continues to this day. However, since WWII, English has been the langauge with the predominant influence.\no\tWritten language used by used by R speakers: 0.  The written language used nowadays is the written variety of Standard Japanese.\no\tLanguage of religion of most R speakers: 0. Religion is still almost exclusively conducted in Japanese.\n\nThere are two further problems with Japanese.\n\u2022\tThe period prior to the Nara period. The introduction of Chinese culture to Japan precedes any extant written records in Japan. Since there are some words that are believed from this period, it would be desirable to provide such a classification as well. However, much less is known about this period. Some scholars assume that there was a large scale immigration from the Korean peninsula, introducing the Chinese culture to Japan. This is controversial at this point, however, and thus it is not clear how this would have to be classified.\n\u2022\tDue to the role of Classical Chinese as the medium of writing in Japan, it has provided a steady source of coinages even towards later periods. This has to be differentiated clearly from borrowings."", ""fd_year"": ""As the Age field was restricted to the language periods, this field was used to record the year of when the word was first attested in Japanese written records. The years are based on Nippon Kokugo Daijiten (2000), and if the first attestation was in an important work of literature, the name is also given in Japanese characters. This is especially true for Old Japanese."", ""fd_effect"": ""Replacement: \n\nWhen a new word is borrowed into a language, and if there already is an existent word, the new word rarely ever simply \u2018replaces\u2019 the old one. The two words are in co-existence until one of them might fall into disuse. I have assumed a replacement to have taken place when an older term has fallen into disuse or has become exceedingly rare. The exact details will only become clear after a thorough philological analysis. If it was unclear if an older term existed and if the concept was unlikely to have been newly introduced to Japan, the value was set to \u201cNo Information\u201d. A number of examples for this, taken from the database:\n\n\u2022\tshinseki \u2018relatives\u2019 replaced ukara, yakara (obsolete)\n\u2022\tjishin \u2018earthquake\u2019 replaced nawi (can still be found in dialects)\n\u2022\tbokuj\u014d \u2018pasture\u2019 replaced maki (poetic language)\n\u2022\tkoji \u2018orphan\u2019 replaced minashigo (poetic)\n\u2022\tbasu \u2018bus\u2019 replaced noriaijid\u014dsha (might be used in formal language)\n\u2022\tdenki \u2018electricity\u2019 replaced ereikishiteito (obsolete)\n\u2022\tninshin suru \u2018get pregnant\u2019 replaced haramu (rare)\n\u2022\tshitai \u2018corpse\u2019 replaced shikabane (rare)\n\u2022\tkenk\u014d \u2018healthy\u2019 replaced sukoyaka (rare)\n\nA variety of sources was used in the attempt to find words used in older periods of Japanese that might have fallen out of use by now: the Nippon Kokugo Daijiten, which was used for any entry, and in some cases Daigenkai and Serifu 2007.\n\nInsertion: \n\nIf it can be assumed that the concept associated with term was introduced newly to Japan alongside with the word, this value was used.\n\nCoexistence: \n\nThis was used when the old term continues to be used alongside the newly borrowed term. Loveday 1996:80-82 points out that there is a number of cases where a NJ or SJ term is in co-existence with an English loanword, and where the former refers to a more traditional version of the concept/object, while the English term to a more modern, Western one.  For instance, tatami is the traditional Japanese matting, while k\u0101petto is a Western-style carpet. Instances like these do not appear often in the database, but as much as they do, they have been treated as cases of co-existence, as for instance in the case of tobira and doa \u201cdoor\u201d."", ""fd_free_meaning"": ""A meaning is entered here, whenever necessary, that is in cases where the Japanese word has a significantly different meaning, or is a hyperonym or hyponym of the LWT meaning. Also,  when a given word was first attested with a meaning different from the LWT meaning, this is noted in W6 and if possible the first attestation for the LWT meaning is given (however, the word is still categorised according to when the form itself was attested, not the particular meaning). Also, commonly used compounds or phrasal expressions involving the word form are also mentioned in this field."", ""fd_comparison_with_mandarin"": ""As the vast majority of loanwords is from Chinese, I have noted differences to usage in Modern Mandarin in the Other comments. In this field, I have categorized the most common differences as follows:\n\u2022\tsemantic change: the word in either language has changed its meaning. If it was possible to determined in which the meaning change occurred, this was indicated as well.\n\u2022\tsemantic extension: as a subcategory of the above, the word in either language has changed its meaning to the effect that in one of the languages the meaning is now broader than in the other.\n\u2022\tdifferent term: Modern Mandarin nowadays uses a different word, which is given in Other comments.\n\u2022\tdifferent variant: Modern Mandarin nowadays uses a different word, which is a variant to the word borrowed into Japanese. For instance, for \u2018herdsman (3.18)\u2019, the Japanese term bokufu \u7267\u592b shares the first character with the word now used in Modern Mandarin, m\u00f9r\u00e9n\u3000\u7267\u4eba (in fact the second characters are just different suffixes used with occupational names). There is a special case of a different variant, where the words in Modern Mandarin and Japanese consist of the same two characters, but in different order. For instrance, for \u2019peace (20.14)\u2019, Japanese uses heiwa \u5e73\u548c, whereas Modern Mandarin uses h\u00e9p\u00edng \u548c\u5e73. These cases have been specifically marked as \u2018different variant (reverse)\u2019. Cf. also Tajima (1998:316-339).\n\u2022\tdifferent frequency: The word is still used in Modern Mandarin, but is now used less frequently than another word more commonly used for the corresponding meaning\n\u2022\tdifference in word class: The words belong to different word classes in Chinese and Japanese.\n\u2022\tgrammaticalization: the word has grammaticalized into a grammatical morpheme in Japanese.\n\u2022\treanalysis as a SJ term: the word is actually not of SJ origin, but originally from NJ, but later reanalyzed as a SJ term. A famous example is the word daikon \u5927\u6839 \u2018daikon\u2019, which was actually a NJ term \u014dne \u2018big root\u2019. Later this was reanalyzed as a SJ term and the SJ reading of the characters in question was applied to the word."", ""fd_hungarian_translation"": null, ""fd_register"": ""This field was only used very sparingly.

Typically, when a given word was representative of scientific or technological knowledge imported from the West in the course of the Meiji modernization, the word has usually been coded as a loan formation; all the more if it was marked by a dictionary as such.

An exception are those words presented in Karlgren 1926, which do not refer to clear cases of innovations transmitted from China to Japan, which are marked as \u201cno information\u201d. \n\nExotic animals and objects that might now be present in zoos or museums have been marked as \u201cnot present\u201d."", ""fd_age"": ""The genealogical classification of the Japanese language is a famously controversial question. Except for the really far-fetched theories such as those linking Japanese to Indo-European, Basque or Sumerian, the majority of the scholars working on the question seems to prefer a relation to either Altaic or Austronesian. In the case of Altaic theories, some scholars restrict themselves to positing a closer relationship between Japanese and Korean (Martin 1966, Lewin 1976, Whitman 1995, Beckwith 2005 arguing for a connection between Koguryoic and Japanese rather than Korean and Japanese), while others then relate Japanese and Korean (and usually Ainu as well) to the Altaic family as a whole (Miller 1971, Miller 1996, and Vovin 1994). For the Austronesian theories, usually an Altaic-Austronesian superstrate-substrate mix is proposed (Polivanov 1918), although Benedict 1990 has proposed a genetic connection to Austronesian, Miao-Yao and Tai-Kadai, resulting in a super-family called \u201cJapanese/Austro-Tai\u201d. However, Vovin 1994 argues against Benedict 1990 on a number of methodological grounds.  I will follow Vovin 1994 in its criticism and assume that Austronesian does not have a genetic link to Japanese, but very well might have a substrate relationship. Finally, it should be noted, that even for the most convincing theory, the Altaic/Korean hypothesis, the number of cognates does not exceed 320. For this reason I decided to include the information on possible Korean-Japanese cognates in a separate custom field 8 \u201cKorean\u201d, rather than including this in the Age field, which I have restricted to periods Japanese written records are available for. This would set the earliest period at the 8th century AD. The field follows a periodisation based on a superset of historical periods that seems to be agreed upon by most authors, even though there are slight differences:\n\n\u2014\tOld Japanese (J\u014dko Nihongo\u4e0a\u53e4\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e, abbreviated OJ): this is usually equated with the historical Nara Period (710-794). It represents the period with the earliest written records of Japanese, even though some ritual texts (Norito, s. Philippi 1959:1-4 and Bentley 2001:6-36) that were recorded in that period might originally have been devised a century or so prior to their publication date. \n\u2014\tLate Old Japanese, also called Classical Japanese by some (Ch\u016bko Nihongo\u4e2d\u53e4\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e, abbreviated as CJ): This is usually equated with the historical Heian Period (794-1185).\n\u2014\tMiddle Japanese (Ch\u016bsei Nihongo\u4e2d\u4e16\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e): this spans the three historical periods, which are usually referred to as the Japanese Middle Ages: Kamakura, Muromachi and Azuchi-Momoyama, all together from 1185-1603. Contact with the West actually ensues from the mid-1500s, thus the first influx of vocabulary from Western languages still falls towards the end of Middle Japanese.\n\u2014\tEarly Modern Japanese (Kinsei Nihongo\u8fd1\u4e16\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e): This is usually equated with the Edo Period (1604-1867), a period where Japan isolates itself politically, but where a trading outpost is maintained in Nagasaki with an intensive exchange with the Dutch trading mission posted there.\n\u2014\tModern Japanese (Gendai Nihongo\u73fe\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e): Japan is forced to open up to the outside world in the 1850s and embarks on an endeavour of rapid modernisation and westernisation of the country, ushering in the Meiji Restoration in 1867/8. \n\nAs far as the period prior to the first written records is concerned, cf. the remarks under W9 in the section on the Native Japanese stratum, regarding the putative early loans from Classical Chinese into Old Japanese and the alleged substrate items from Austronesian."", ""fd_analyzability"": ""The following criteria have been followed in assigning the analyzability values in the database:\n\nUnanalyzable\n\nThis is chosen when the word cannot be further analyzed in modern Japanese, including verbs and adjectives, which are inflected but whose stem cannot be further broken down. However, reduplicated forms and words that are historically analyzable are viewed as \u2018semi-analyzable\u2019.\n\nSemi-analyzable\n\nA.\tReduplicated forms whose base does not occur on its own. These are usually adverbs, the process is not overly productive. Cf. Hamano 1998. There is also another type of reduplication, which is regarded as a derived form and is discussed below.\nB.\tWords that include a cranberry morph, i.e. an element that does not occur by itself. For instance, katatsumuri \u2018snail\u2019, consists of two elements, kata \u2018single\u2019 and tsumuri, with the latter not appearing on its own. \nC.\tWords that include affixes that are no longer productive and often opaque. For instance taira, which is a contraction from a now opaque prefix ta- and the root hira \u2018flat\u2019. There are also a number of cases involving an adjective suffix \u2013ka, which is no longer productive.\nD.\tWords which are historically polymorphemic but which are now perceived to be monomorphemic. For instance sakana is originally a compound of sake \u2018wine\u2019 and na \u2018food\u2019, this is no longer perceived as such.\nE.\tWords whose original structure has been obscured through time. This is usually because of one of the following factors, or any combination of the three:\n\ta.\twriting: a compound word is written with one character, obscuring the internal structure, or a derived word is written with a character different than the root it is derived from. For instance, mabuta \u2018eyelid\u2019 is originally a compound of me \u2018eye\u2019 and futa \u2018lid\u2019, a fact that is obscured by the fact that mabuta is written in one character. Also, mise \u2018shop\u2019 is said to have been derived from the nominalised form of the verb miseru \u2018to show\u2019, but again this is obscured through the writing.\n\tb.\tcontraction: a compound word that has undergone exceptional phonological change (for instances of regular phonological or morphological change, see Frellesvig 1995). Examples include otto \u2018husband\u2019, a contraction of o \u2018man\u2019 and hito \u2018person\u2019; fude \u2018pen\u2019, from fumi \u2018text\u2019 and te \u2018hand\u2019; h\u014dki \u2018broom\u2019, from ha \u2018leaf\u2019 and haki, the nominalised form of the verb haku \u2018to sweep\u2019.\n\tc.\tphrase: in some cases, what was originally a phrase has become a single word. Often this involves two nouns connected with an attributive marker, such as no, na or the archaic tsu. Without exception, these words are written in one character, and have sometimes undergone further phonological changes of their own. Some examples: kinoko \u2018mushroom\u2019, from the phrase ki no ko \u2018tree\u2019s child\u2019; honoo \u2018flame\u2019, from the phrase hi no ho \u2018fire\u2019s ear\u2019; matsuge \u2018eyelash\u2019, from the phrase me tsu ke \u2018eye\u2019s hair\u2019. \nF.\tVerbs that are marked as transitive or intransitive. As discussed at length in Jacobsen 1992, there is a small number of verbs that forms sets of intransitive-transitive pairs. This process is no longer productive and the marking unpredictable. Whenever this is applicable to a verb in the database, it is noted in W4 whether it is transitive or intransitive and what the form of its counterpart verb is.\nG.\tSino-Japanese compounds were usually regarded as \u2018analyzable compounds\u2019 because of the fact that their internal structure was readily available on account of the logographic characters. However, in certain cases, exceptional phonological change has led to making this less obvious. Usually these words are also no longer written in Chinese characters, but rather with hiragana. Examples include yakan \u2018kettle\u2019, originally a compound of yaku \u2018medicine\u2019 and kan \u2018can\u2019, \n\nAnalyzable derived\n\nA.\tReduplicated forms that form the collective of the base. These are usually from nouns and are regarded as derived forms here. One example is hito-bito \u2018people\u2019 from hito \u2018person\u2019. \nB.\tWords that are derived by affixes. As far as Native Japanese words are concerned, by far the most frequent case is a deverbal noun, derived by means of a nominalising suffix which is identical in form to the stem form (but not in accent, cf. Martin 1988:387). For instance, hikari 'light' is derived from the verb hikaru 'to light'. As for Sino-Japanese words, this usually refers to suffixes used to form nouns.\n\nAnalyzable compound\n\nCompounds are clearly recognisable as such, both from the accent (cf. Akamatsu 2000:268-270) and also from certain morphophonological phenomena that occur with them. For the NJ stratum and some SJ words, rendaku is a common occurrence (however, it should be noted that this is a phenomenon with many exceptions, cf. Shibatani 1990:173-175 and Vance 1987:146-148), and for the SJ stratum, an assimilation of a bisyllabic first element to certain following consonants is common, as in  gakk\u014d 'school', where gaku becomes gak- in front of k\u014d (Vance 1995: 155-164).  For the Sino-Japanese words, it can be argued in some cases whether these are really compound words since some elements nowadays never occur outside of compounds, but due to the high degree of transparency of the Chinese characters to native speakers I have opted to analyse these as compounds. \n\nAnalyzable phrasal\n\nThe entering of phrases into the database was usually avoided and only undertaken when it was the only choice available (sometimes, commonly used phrases were also entered into the W6 field). This was only deviated from when the only nonphrasal expression available was nonstandard or extremely rare.""}",21,Japanese,,,,1

Perhaps borrowed\n\nA.\tPhonological similarity is present but lacks consistent patterns of correspondences and is possibly chance similarity.\nB.\tSuch words are similar to numerous forms seen throughout in East and Southeast Asia, making the question of borrowing versus connected by being related language impossible to answer based on existing data.\n\n3. Probably borrowed \n\nA.\tRegarding likely Chinese loanwords, including ancient Han dynasty borrowings and borrowings in Post-Tang Dynasty era, such words show consistent phonological and semantic patterns though they are not listed in Sino-Vietnamese dictionaries as Chinese in origin.\nB.\tRegarding possible Tai loanwords, such words are considered likely borrowed due to the combination of consistent phonological and semantic patterns and the sociolinguistic situations in which the borrowings may have taken place.\n\n4. Clearly borrowed\n\nA.\tThousand of words that are listed in Sino-Vietnamese dictionaries as Chinese in origin are accepted as such. Such records are the result of documentation spanning more than a millennium and can be considered highly reliable.\nB.\tOther words in this category are words borrowed from French and/or English. These words are phonologically and semantically consistent.

As the time depth and potential complexity of language contact situations are substantial, such information helps to support the accuracy of the claims. The age of each entry depends in part on whether a word is native or borrowed vocabulary. Borrowed vocabulary is estimated within a period of centuries, while dates of native vocabulary are not given. Only the distance back into the sub-branches under Austroasiatic can be approximately determined. The degree of certainty of the timing depends on available records, as discussed below.\n\nEras of Borrowing\n\nPre-Han Dynasty: Before 200 BCE\nHan Dynasty: 200s BCE to 200s CE\nTang Dynasty: 700s to 1000s\nPost-Tang Dynasty: 1000s to 1800s\nModern Era: Late-1800s to the present\n\nNative Vietnamese Vocabulary from Austroasiatic Languages\n\n1.\tVietnamese\n2.\tProto-Viet-Muong\n3.\tProto-Vietic\n4.\tProto-Eastern-Mon-Khmer\n5.\tProto-North-Eastern-Mon-Khmer\n6.\tProto-Mon-Khmer\n7.\tProto-Austroasiatic\n\nAustroasiatic consists of over 150 languages (Gordon) in a territory which extends from Southern China to the tip of peninsular Malaysia to Northeastern India. There is a wide range of perspectives among researchers (Diffloth 1989, Pejros 1998, and Shorto 2006) regarding subgrouping within the Mon-Khmer language group within Austroasiatic. The tentative subgrouping within Austroasiatic considered in this database, which includes Proto-Northeastern and Proto-Eastern Mon-Khmer based on the depth of lexical preservation and innovation, is described in Alves 2005b, though some modifications for specific words were made based on data in Shorto 2006."", ""fd_comment_on_borrowed"": ""The comments in this field mainly refer to words of Chinese origin which are not literary borrowings entered in standard Sino-Vietnamese dictionaries.

Other compounds include those which contain a mix of Chinese and native morphs (e.g., \u0111\u00e0n \u00f4ng (\u0111\u00e0n is Vietnamese and \u00f4ng is Chinese \u7fc1) \u201cman\u201d) and those which consist of only native morphs (e.g., ch\u00f3 con (both syllables are Proto-Austroasiatic etyma) \u201cpuppy\u201d).\n\nB.\tPhrasal compounds: Such forms in the database typically are translations of borrowed concepts which are not part of daily usage (e.g., \u0111\u00e0n \u00f4ng c\u00f3 v\u1ee3 (unit-gentleman-have-wife) \u201cmarried man\u201d).\n\nC.\tReduplicated forms: In some cases in reduplicated compounds, the base morpheme is recognizable as a free morph, while the reduplicated morph only appears in the reduplicated form (e.g., tr\u1ed3ng tr\u1ecdt \u201cto cultivate,\u201d in which only the syllable tr\u1ed3ng \u201cto plant\u201d is a free morph)."", ""fd_borrowed_base"": ""Comments in this field are for words that contain both native and borrowed elements in ways that are likely the direct result of language contact with some awareness of the borrowed element as foreign."", ""fd_form"": ""The lexical entries consist of common, modern, less technical vocabulary among a choice of synonymous forms.

We do know that the word pot was borrowed from Latin, and again I have indicated this as Present in pre-contact environment, even though we do not know what it used to be called."", ""abbreviations"": ""No special abbreviations."", ""fd_analyzability"": ""For analyzability, I have concentrated on contemporary language use: do modern speakers consider a certain form to be a derivation/compound or not? This may involve, for instance, the word draad \u2018thread\u2019 being labelled unanalyzable, although from a historical point of view it is derived from the verb draaien \u2018to turn\u2019 - the suffix -d has, however, for many centuries been unproductive. Likewise, the old and by now unrecognizable suffix \u2013el is regarded as being unanalyzable; it was formerly used to form instrument names such as beitel \u2018chisel\u2019, schoffel \u2018hoe\u2019 and diminutives like eikel \u2018acorn\u2019. And sprinkhaan \u2018grasshopper\u2019, finally, is regarded as semi-analyzable from a contemporary point of view: it has haan \u2018cock\u2019 for its second element, obviously, but the first part - the stem of the verb springen \u2018to leap\u2019 \u2013 is no longer recognizable as such.\n\tOn the other hand, hangmat \u2018hammock\u2019 is counted as an analyzable compound: the word was borrowed from Spanish hamaca, but through folk etymology it has been adapted in such a way that modern speakers regard it as being a compound of hangen \u2018to hang\u2019 and mat \u2018mat\u2019.\n\tFor the (un-)analyzability of verbs, the following arguments have been used: Dutch has a small group of verbs in -n such as slaan \u2018to strike, hit, beat\u2019, doen \u2018to do\u2019. The great majority of verbs, however, end in -en \u2013 these are all considered to be analyzable, even when they have been borrowed. They are either semi-analyzable (like sterven, the first element having no meaning), or analyzable derived (like hoesten: cough-INF, see hereafter), or analyzable compound ( aansteken: aan-steken [on-stick-INF]. If a stem has both a noun and a verb, like hoest \u2018cough\u2019 and hoesten \u2018to cough\u2019 or slaap \u2018sleep\u2019 and slapen \u2018to sleep\u2019, it is, within our contemporary linguistic system, impossible to judge which of the two is the original form and which the derivation \u2013 even historically, it is often not feasible to determine this. In these cases I have consistently labelled the noun (slaap) unanalyzable and the verb (slapen) analyzable derived ([sleep etc.-INF]). Dutch has a number of prefixes for verb derivation that are very old and whose meaning cannot clearly be described: be-, ver- and ont-; for these prefixes I have usually indicated only whether the verb derived is transitive or intransitive."", ""fd_reference"": ""In the database:\nEWB 1997 = Veen, P.A.F. van, and Nicoline van der Sijs. 1997.

Most of the dates mentioned in these works come from the quotations given in the three big historical dictionaries of the Dutch language, the WNT, the MNW and the VMNW. For the period up to the 13th century we have few sources, and the dates for this period have always been found quite by accident. We know about many native words that they must already have existed then as well, but it is not until the 13th century that we have a reasonable number of texts at our disposal. But also dates found for other periods are always more or less relative and accidental. For French and English there is a rich tradition in the domain of datings, but even there scholars keep on correcting and supplementing. In Holland, the situation is much less propitious - datings have been investigated and provided for only a few decades there. Not a single date can be accepted as absolute, every date is an indication for a period. And it is \""work in progress\"": more and more sources have of late become available digitally, making it possible for ever better and older locations to be discovered. Still, the data I have supplied give an indication about the century since when the word has been known in Dutch."", ""fd_borrowed"": ""In the case of most words, we know whether they are native Dutch words or have been borrowed. In the case of only a few words have I indicated that they are \""perhaps borrowed\"".\n\tA special category is formed by personal names in -er and -aar. The suffix -er in personal names is, historically, partly native and partly borrowed \u2013 present-day native speakers feel it to be wholly native. I have therefore labelled personal names with this suffix as native (not: created on loan basis) and unanalyzable whenever there is no obvious verb underlying (as with herder \u2018herdsman\u2019). When there is another word underlying the psersonal name, I have labelled it analyzable derived, as with kleermaker \u2018tailor\u2019 [dress-make-AGT] or visser \u2018fisherman\u2019 [fish-AGT]. Some nouns were borrowed in toto, e.g. dokter \u2018physician\u2019, meester \u2018master\u2019 \u2013 these are then labelled 4. Clearly borrowed and unanalyzable. The same goes for the suffix -aar in personal mames: officially, it was derived from Latin, it is very old and still productive \u2013 it is used side by side with -er; in the past, the two forms were frequently mixed up. Words with the suffix -aar are thus considered to be native and analyzable derived, e.g. bedelaar \u2018beggar\u2019 [beg-AGT] and handelaar \u2018merchant\u2019 [trade-AGT].\n\tIn nearly all cases, the meaning of the loanword has remained unchangd in Dutch; only in some exceptional cases, where the meaning has deviated, have I indicated this under Meaning (W16).\n\tOnly the immediate source word and donor language have been filled in, not the earliest known source word."", ""fd_hungarian_translation"": null}",12,Dutch,,,,1

These loanwords escaped the effects of the Bantu contact period and its thorough phonological influence on older vocabulary. They are easier to recognize because their shapes have not changed so much from their lending form and their phonotactics is very different from that of inherited Malagasy words. Moreover, they denote, as a rule, concepts that are adapted from the contexts of experience that their respective lending languages belong to. There are consequently few cases that have a doubtful borrowing status.\n\tThe treatment of Austronesian and Sanskrit loanwords I present here is based on my own analysis, although most Sanskrit loanwords had already been identified by previous scholars. The description of Bantu loanwords is largely based on Dahl (1988). These older loanwords are much more difficult to spot because they have undergone the changes that took place during the Bantu contact period. Their phonological shapes are thoroughly transformed and they are relatively well-adapted to the inherited Malagasy word structure. Their status as loanwords is therefore more difficult to demonstrate than in the case of Arabic, European, and recent Swahili and Comorian loanwords. There is also no fast rule to determine their status, as it is based on a combination of phonological, semantic, cultural and historical factors, which work out differently in individual cases. In a very general way, I tend to use rating 1 (very little evidence of borrowing) with loanwords from before the Bantu contact period in cases where I disagree with other scholars that a certain word is borrowed. I use rating 2 to 4 if a Malagasy word reflects a phonemic correspondence which is diagnostic for borrowing, and its meaning is similar to \u2013 or compatible with - that of the lending form. Such diagnostic correspondences are, for instance, Malagasy s, r, ts, or tr respectively corresponding to s, r, c and (alveolar or retroflex) d in the alleged Austronesian or Sanskrit lending language. These correspondences are irregular and indicate that the word in question could be borrowed. The more such phonemes occur within a given word, the more likely it is to be a loanword, and the higher rating I will be using. In the same way, I use rating 2 to 4 for words containing a b, p, g, or non-root-final k, if these phonemes correspond to b, p, g or k in Malay words with a compatible meaning. Such words may be loanwords borrowed from Malay after Bantu contact period. Finally, I use rating 2 in some cases where a word begins with ki- or tsi- and denotes a noun, as this suggests a Bantu origin. This is the case with kibo \u2018stomach\u2019, for which I found corresponding forms in neither other Austronesian languages, nor in Bantu languages. (If I had found a corresponding form with a compatible meaning in Swahili, Comorian or another East African Bantu language, I might have used rating 3 or 4)."", ""fd_hungarian_translation"": null, ""fd_reference"": ""Primary references used in compiling the database\n\nInformation about Malay and Javanese loanwords is based on Adelaar (1989, 1995a, 1995b and 2009).

Proto Oceanic, the language of the Lapita culture at the time that it expanded eastward around 1200 BC, came into being as the result of contact between the Austronesian speakers who arrived in the Bismarck Archipelago around 1400 BC and speakers of Papuan languages whose ancestors had long been in New Guinea and the Bismarcks. I have labelled this period Early Oceanic. Proto Oceanic was originally posited by Dempwol\ufb00 (1937) and has since been \ufb01rmly reconstructed (Lynch et al. 2002:Ch.4).\nPre-Oceanic means\u2018 Austronesian speaking before 1400 BC\u2019. The early limit of 3500 BC is the earliest data for a culture associated with Austronesian, but it is not really meaningful to set a start date in this way.\nThe end dates of the Pre-Oceanic, Early Oceanic, Western Oceanic, New Guinea Oceanic, North New Guinea, Ngero-Vitiaz and Bel periods are associated with the reconstructed interstages which we label \u2018Proto Western Oceanic\u2019, \u2018Proto New Guinea Oceanic\u2019, and so on. Note that these proto languages represent cross-sections of ongoing language change, rather than periods of time. The fact that a lexical item in the Takia database is said to be descended from are constructed etymon in, say, Proto Ngero-Vitiaz says only that an ancestral form was present in Proto Ngero-Vitiaz. It entered the language at the latest during the Ngero-Vitiaz period, and may have entered it earlier, but there is currently no data to support an earlier reconstruction. The protolanguages from Western Oceanic through to Bel are justi\ufb01ed by \nRoss (1988). There are also reconstructions in the database for Proto Western Bel. Western Bel is the subgroup which includes Takia, Megiar (a dialect of Takia), Bilibil and the various dialects of Gedaged (Gedaged proper, Riwo and Siar). I assign Proto Western Bel to the Early Takia period, as explained below.\nExcept for the end date for Bel, the dates for the prehistoric periods listed in the previous paragraph are based on the correlation of reconstructed linguistic events with known archaeological events. There is room for error, both in the correlation and in the archaeology. The dates associated with Pre-Oceanic and Early Oceanic are well accepted in the historical linguistic and archaeological literature are quite well founded (Spriggs 1997, Kirch 1997,1998). Western Oceanic was the network of dialects left behind on New Britain and New Ireland after the initial wave of eastward migration. Ross (1988:382\u2013386) proposed that there were two waves of Oceanic settlement eastward into the northwest Solomons area and that the second was associated with the break-up of Western Oceanic, dated to around 900 BC on the basis that there was late Lapita settlement on Buka Island by 800 BC and on New Georgiaby 600 BC (Sheppard and Walter 2006).\nThe break-up of New Guinea Oceanic, spoken (I assume) in western New Britain, must have occurred around 200 BC, as the archaeology of the south coast of Central Papua suggests that Oceanic speakers had reached there by 100 BC (Vanderwal 1973). The continuing network of dialects on New Britain represents the North New Guinea period, until the Vitiaz Strait area was resettled by Oceanic speakers sometime between 300 and 500 AD following a post-Lapita hiatus in settlement. This represents the beginning of the archaeological Sio pottery period (Lilley 1999, 2000, In press). The Ngero-Vitiaz end date of 1000 AD represents the appearance of new pottery types (Lilley 1999, Specht et al. 2006, Lilley and Specht In press, westward expansion along the coast and o\ufb00shore islands, and the probable begin\u00acnings of the Vitiaz Strait trade network, which persisted until after European contact in the twentieth century (Harding 1967).\nAccording to oral tradition, the ancestors of all speakers of Bel languages (Takia is a member of the Bel family) lived on Yomba Island, where Hankow Reef is located, until it disappeared under the waves (Mennis 2006). I estimate that this occurred around 1600, and that the ancestors of the Takia settled on Karkar around 1680 after a tsunami had wiped out the earlier population (for the oral history, see McSwain 1977:24, for dating Ross 2007b). The Early Takia period is the last prehistoric period before the arrival of German missionaries. It is also the period in which I infer that loans from Bargam and Waskia occurred. A number of items are reconstructable for Proto Western Bel on the basis of the cognates given in Mager\u2019s (1952) Gedaged dictionary. I have not assigned these to a separate \u2018period\u2019 of Takia history. They belong to a time when the Western Bel languages, listed earlier, were still more or less a unity. I assume this to have been for a relatively short period of time before and after theTakia settled in Karkar Island, and I have assigned such items to \u2018Early Takia\u2019.\nThe history of Takia since European contact is known to us, at least in outline. German Lutheran missionaries were active on Karkar from 1888 to 1895, but made little impact. I have allowed the Early Takia period to extend into the historical period up to 1912, as there is no evidence of borrowing before 1912. A second group arrived in 1912 and were more successful, but were forced out by Germany\u2019s wartime defeat in 1918 (Wagner and Hermann 1986:109\u2013110, 127\u2013129). I have labelled this early period of six years the Early missionary period. I have left a gap in periodization between 1918 and 1935 since I know of no conditions likely to lead to borrowing during that period. \nAfter the transfer of New Guinea (the northern half of modern mainland Papua NewGuinea) to Australian sovereignty, German and Australian Lutheran missionaries continued their activities, and in 1935 Gedaged (or Graged), another Bel language (described in a manuscript grammar by Dempwol\ufb00 (n.d.)) was adopted as a lingua franca by the mission and was used extensively in education and in church activities. Narer on Karkar Island was an important educational and missionary centre. This period, which I call the Gedaged schools period lasted until 1962, when the mission largely replaced Gedaged with the national lingua franca Tok Pisin (Freyberg 1977, Ross 1996).\nTok Pisin had doubtless already made inroads on Karkar before the second World War, however from about 1935, and was already spoken by most of the population in 1962. Today all Takia speakers are bilingual in Tok Pisin. I call the period during which Tok Pisin has been a lingua franca on Karkar the modern period, as it extends into the present. Recent years have seen a reduction in the in\ufb02uence of the Lutheran Church on Karkar and a growth in a number of smaller Christian denominations. Only one borrowing on the list (\u2018to fast\u2019) is attributable to this last period, which I call the smaller missions period. The Gedaged schools period and the smaller missions period both overlap with the modern period, but this is necessary if the dating of twentieth-centruty loans is to be as accurate as the data allow."", ""fd_form"": ""The orthography used for pre-modern lexical items here and in the database is a phonemic spelling . This di\ufb00ers in two respects from the practical orthography adopted by the Summer Institute of Linguistics in consultation with Takia speakers and used by Ross (2002). Vowels other than -a- which occur in syllables before the stress are inserted by rule: either -i- or -u-. Inserted vowels are often written in the practical orthography, but this results in alternative orthographic representations of the same word (with inserted i or inserted u or neither). For consistency\u2019s sake inserted vowels are not written here. Second, there are several differences involving w and y. The main one concerns the phonological interpretation of wordswith falling phonetic vowel sequences such as the following, where [tigi\u2032yo] \u2018we called you\u2019 and [tusu\u2032we] \u2018we poked (it)\u2019 are represented phonemically as t-gy-\u00f3 and t-sw\u00e9 respectively.That is, the intervocalic glides [y] and [w] are considered to represent phonemes, whilst the\ufb01rst vowel of the sequence is interpreted as an insertion. This allows for simpler generalisations about the insertion of pre-stress vowels than in previous work, where these words wereinterpreted as t(i)-gi-o and t(u)-sue respectively.\nMorphosyntactic facts that need to be known in order to interpret the wordlist data, and especially the morpheme-by-morpheme glosses, are: \n\u2022\tVerbs always have a pre\ufb01x coreferential with the subject, e.g.\u014b-aw \u2018Igo\u2019, y-aw \u2018he/she/it goes\u2019 etc. Their citation forms are shown with an initial hyphen, e.g. -aw \u2018go\u2019. \n\u2022\tNouns may be either alienably or inalienably possessed. Inalienably possessed nouns have a su\ufb03x coreferential with the possessum,e.g. bani-g \u2018my hand\u2019, bani-n \u2018his/her/its hand\u2019. Their citation formsare shown with a \ufb01nal hyphen, e.g. bani-\u2018 hand\u2019. \n\u2022\tThe possessor su\ufb03x and subject pre\ufb01x are omitted in a phrasal citation form and in its a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss if the a\ufb03xes vary in person and number. Thus the citation form for \u2018to love\u2019 is bbe- -pani (heart--give) \u2018give (one\u2019s) heart\u2019, with the variants bbe-n i-pani (heart-his 3SG-give) \u2018s/he loves\u2019, bbe-g \u014b-pani (heart-my 1SG give) \u2018I love\u2019, and so on. \n\u2022\tMany adjectives also take a possessor su\ufb03x. Again, the citation form is shown with a \ufb01nal hyphen, e.g. sae- \u2018bad\u2019. An adjective of this type always takes the 3SG su\ufb03x -n when it is used predicatively. An attributive adjective follows the noun it modi\ufb01es, and in the past took a possessor su\ufb03x agreeing in number and person with that noun. Increasingly in modern Takia the su\ufb03x is -n regardless of agreement."", ""fd_comment_on_borrowed"": ""If this \ufb01eld is \ufb01lled, it generally contains either the comment \u2018No evidence available about either borrowing or inheritance\u2019 or a reconstruction for one of the protolanguages listed below, preceded by the relevant abbreviation: \n\n\tPOc\tProto Oceanic \n\n\tPWOc\tProto Western Oceanic \n\n\tPNGOc\tProto New Guinea Oceanic \n\n\tPNNG\tProto North New Guinea\n\n\tPNgVz\tProto Ngero-Vitiaz \n\n\tPBel\tProto Bel \n\n\tPWBel\tProto Western Bel"", ""fd_analyzability"": ""Determinations here are straightforward except for items that include enclitics.

Seven distinct comments have been defined as well as the \u201cNo information.\u201d  The description of the distinct contexts of use labels provided for loanwords is provided below:\n\nCommon in Yaqui usage: Most Yaqui speakers would use loanwords included within this contact situation. Many of them have been documented among distinct oral and written language materials. \n\nCommonly used by Men: Specialized loanwords most of them related to different trades, some of them: agriculture, construction or bricklayers or blacksmith\u2019s trade, e.g. biiga  \u2018rafter, suuko  \u2018furrow\u2019.  \n\nFormal use: Loanwords which emerge dealing with government, administrative, health discussions.\n\nFormal use at schools:  Loanwords used at schools are described as pertaining to this contact situation, e.g. auritoorio \u2018meeting house\u2019, chimenea \u2018chimney\u2019, kancha \u2018court\u2019, kontinente \u2018mainland, \u2018continent\u2019, wolpo \u2018gulf\u2019. Such loanwords are not colloquial neither used on a daily basis. \n\nNo information: This criterion is provided when is hard to describe the exact contact situation where the loanword is used, even though consultants recognize the loanword but it is hard to define their contact situation, e.g. maayam boosam \u2018the netbag\u2019.\n\nUsed in highly bilingual contexts: Loanwords which probably emerge when the Yaqui are making a specifc reference in a conversation with a non-Yaqui speaker or with somebody who understands Yaqui but is not from this ethnic group, e.g. ejkulpiroa \u2018esculpir\u2019, piino \u2018the pine\u2019, piipa \u2018pipe\u2019, sittriko \u2018citrus\u2019, sorwo \u2018the millet\u2019, \u2018the sorghum\u2019. Commonly occurrs when Yaqui are dealing with topics not related to their daily life and most of the time are due to the discussion of newspapers in Spanish or topics from TV, etc. They well could be taken as instances of code-switching. \n \nUsed outside the Yaqui communities: Almost the same as the last criterion, but deals with words which would occur when the Yaqui are outside their communities, being at the hospital or visiting some city or town outside their communities. \n\nUsed outside the Yaqui communities and probably used only by women:  Loanwords used by women when they are doing some shopping outside their communities. In daily language use, such loanwords are hardly used,  e.g. liino \u2018flax\u2019, piltro \u2018felt\u2019, seeda \u2018silk\u2019."", ""fd_form"": ""The vocabulary includes words which are rarely used, most of them words used in two kinds of situations: (i) when a speaker of Yaqui is talking with a non-Yaqui speaker who understands Yaqui, or (ii) when somebody, outside of a Yaqui community, is speaking about topics that are concerned with external situations, i.e. discussions about politics, sports, mode, health, US products. Words used at school are also considered.\n\nAll words are provided in the practical orthography defined by the Yaqui teachers in charge of the Bilingual program. \n\nThere are very few cases where more than one word is listed in this field.

The age category was sometimes arbitrary, since Yaqui is a language with no tradition in writing, the documentation of the language is scarce. All documented loanwords entered to Yaqui via Spanish, and probably a handful entered directly from Nahuatl.  Based on the historical documentation of Yaqui, there are only two important historical periods to trace the loanwords:\n\na.\tOld (colonial age)\nb.\tModern\n\nThe Old colonial age value is applied with cultural objects introduced to the New World by the Spaniards; the criterion is mainly applied when the phonological adaptation of loanwords is evident, that is, it involves more than one phonological change, or there is also evidence of phonological traces of Spanish old phonemes. Very few lexical items has been traced within the linguistic material written by Thomas Basilio\u2019s Arte de la lengua cahita (Buelna 1890); although this grammar deals with Tehueco, a different dialect. Thus, loanwords like kaba\u2019i  \u2018horse\u2019 < Spanish caballo, are considered old, as well saweeam \u2018breeches\u2019 < Spanish \u2018zaraguelles\u2019, moina \u2018mill\u2019 < Spanish molino, where the /l/ phoneme is elided and the final vowel /o/ changes into /a/; or saabum \u2018soap\u2019 < Spanish xabon, where the Spanish letter <x> was still a palatal fricative /sh/ and not yet the modern velar fricative /x/.\n\nThe Modern value is assigned when loanwords reflect almost no phonological change or are used to name a modern referent, e.g. radio, bank.\n\nFor Yaqui words, five categories for \u2018Age\u2019 have been chosen. The application of such criteria is sometimes arbitrary, because it is sometimes difficult to trace the history of words in non-written languages:\n\na.\tProto-Uto-Aztecan\nb.\tProto-Sonoran\nc.\tProto-Tara-Cahitan\nd.\tProto-Cahitan\ne.\tModern\n\nThe Proto-Uto-Aztecan age has been applied to words which are recognized to have a cognate among the Uto-Aztecan cognate sets (Miller 1967, Voegelin, Voegelin and Hale 1962). The Proto-Sonoran age is applied to those words which share a root at least in one Tepiman language (Bascom 1965 and my own knowledge and field notes from Pima Bajo), and in at least one Tara-Cahitan language, Tarahumara (Hilton 1959, Brambila 1980), Yaqui (Estrada et al. 2004, Johnson 1962) or Mayo (Collard and Collard 1984). The Proto-Tara-Cahitan age is applied when no Tepiman counterpart has been identified. The Proto-Cahitan age is applied to those words for which no Tepiman correlated root has been identified within the language material in Bascom (1965), and Estrada\u2019s Pima Bajo dictionary in preparation or in other Taracahitan language \u2013 Estrada et al. (2004), Molina et al. (1999), Johnson (1962), and Collard and Collard (1984). The last category, Modern, is assigned to  words which are phrasal and compound words, e.g. su\u2019utojiwame \u2018to divorce\u2019, or jujupwame \u2018the wedding\u2019, or motcho\u2019okol \u2018chamaleon\u2019, as well as those which occur only in Yaqui: e.g. momoi \u2018ripe\u2019, bikala \u2018rotten\u2019, or u\u2019ukte \u2018to choke\u2019, and words which look like neologisms or new creations: e.g. jiawai \u2018music\u2019, bebeje\u2019eri  \u2018demon\u2019, yoojoara \u2018hell\u2019.\n\nNo information is assigned to words not borrowed from Spanish, but from Nahuatl or Taino, where there is no secure way to establish their source."", ""fd_borrowed"": ""Criteria used to determine the degree of certainty are the following:\n\n0. No evidence about borrowing\nWords which are considered as Yaqui, as well as those which seem to be originated in Yaqui as a result of a previous loanword, e.g. ili jamut \u2018girl\u2019, kaba\u2019i jamut \u2018mare\u2019 are marked with this criterion. \n\n1.

In fact, a handful of the borrowings are clearly very recent because they are terms used in Chinese only after 1949 when the Communists took over the government from the Nationalists.\n\nThe Dagur loans were assigned the age of 20th century or earlier due to the fact that some of the borrowings may have entered Oroqen well before the 20th century since the two ethnic groups have coexisted in a mutually dependent relationship for centuries. \n\nMongolic borrowings are also assigned the age of 20th century or earlier for a similar reason as that of the Dagur. The main difference is that the contact between the two groups was not as intense and persistent as the contact between the Oroqen and the Dagur. \n\nThe loans from Russian are mostly given the age of 20th century or earlier because their contact goes far into their history from before their migration into China.

26,"{""fd_age"": ""Loans from Malay were easily identified for the most part. The major difficulty was in trying to stratify what potentially amounts to over 1,000 years of influence. The Malay migration to the peninsula from Borneo commenced around 2,000 \u2013 1,500 years ago, with maritime traders arriving in the peninsula. The Orang Asli were engaged in the extraction and trade of forest products with these traders, and Malay became the lingua franca of the region. This may well have been the source of early loans, assuming the Ceq Wong had direct contact with the traders. Alternatively, they may have acquired Malay loans from an intermediary Aslian group, e.g. the neighbouring Jah-Hut, or from an indigenous Austronesian group like the Temuan. It is not possible to determine the age of any but the most recent Malay loans which relate to \u2018new world discoveries or innovations\u2019. Introduced foodstuffs which originated in the new world, e.g., \u2018maize\u2019 and \u2018chili\u2019 are dated as \u2018Post 15th century\u2019. Malay loans which are themselves borrowed from English are dated as late 19th century until the middle of the 20th century, and some modern innovations are dated as Post World War II, e.g., \u2018ice\u2019, electricity\u2019, motor vehicles\u2019. Overall there are no clear indicators that enable the earlier period to be stratified in any meaningful way, and as a result the age of the majority of Malay loans is given as \u2018no information\u2019. \n\nNumerical dates for Aslian/MonKhmer are based on currently accepted dates. The oldest date given is Proto-Mon-Khmer (c. -5,000); cognates determined largely with the assistance Shorto (2006). Although there are obviously cognates in Proto-Austroasiatic, this was avoided as the etymological data was scant and the result would have presented an inaccurate picture."", ""fd_borrowed"": ""Loans from Austronesian were easily determined for the most part. The difficulty in determining whether they were from Malay or another western Austronesian language was sometimes encountered. Notes are recorded for individual entries where this became an issue.\nGiven the low level of documentation of Aslian, work on intra-Aslian contact remains in its infancy, and there is currently no published reconstruction of Proto-Aslian available. It was therfore virtually impossible to differentiate inherited forms from potential intra-Aslian loans. Some potential loans were determined on the basis of identical or near-identical form and meaning in both languages, e.g. Ceq Wong and Jah-Hut pigo\u0294 \u2018chili\u2019, and an absence of this same combination in other Aslian languages, where data was available.

Very little evidence for borrowing\n \nA. Words it is difficult to determine the direction of the borrowing because the etymon is similarly attested (either well or poorly) in both donor language and borrowing language families, but the evidence does not favor borrowing into Indonesian. \nB. Words which have been claimed by some authorities to be loanwords, but I find the evidence unconvincing.\nC. Words which show some similarity in sound and meaning to a word in another language, but the similarity is not great, and there is insufficient independent evidence to determine whether it is indeed a case of borrowing.  \n \n2. Perhaps borrowed\n \nA. Words which violate a minor phonotactic constraint of inherited Malay vocabulary, and do not have a good internal etymology. \nB. Words that are related by borrowing to similar words in other  \nlanguages, but for which it is more likely that Indonesian (or Austronesian) was  \nthe donor language rather than the borrowing language. \nC. Words which show some similarity in sound and meaning to a word in another language; while the similarity is not great, there is some independent evidence in support of borrowing, for example from an intermediate language.  \n\n3. Probably borrowed \n \nA. Words which clearly violate the phonotactics of inherited Malay vocabulary, and cannot be reconstructed in Proto Malayic, even if no source word can be identified.\nB. Words which somewhat violate Malayic phonotactics, and for which there is a reasonable candidate for a source word, although there are phonological and/or semantic differences between the source word and loanword that are not easily explained.\nC. Words which clearly violate Malayic phonotactics, and are well represented in modern Malayic isolects, but denote a concept which was not present during the period when Proto Malayic was spoken.\n \n4. Clearly borrowed\n \nA. Words which have an equivalent in another language that constitutes a close phonological and semantic match, and the proposed source word is well attested in the donor language family.\nB. Words which have a close phonological match in another language, even though the semantics do not match well, but the semantic difference can be logically explained.\nC. Words which have close semantic match in another language, even though the phonology doesn\u2019t match well, but the phonological differences can be logically explained.\n\nNotes:\n1. A lack of clear etymology with no further evidence for borrowing was not deemed sufficient to suspect a word to be a loanword.  \n2. For the purpose of this field, the presence of the verbal prefixes meng- (active), di- (passive), and ber- (intransitive) were ignored.  A word containing just one of these prefixes and no other affixation was considered as a loanword if its base was determined to be a loanword.  This is because the process of borrowing words which function as verbs in standard Indonesian requires the use of a verbal prefix.  If other affixation is present, even if one of the above three prefixes is also used, the word was classified as \u2018Created on loan basis\u2019.\n3. Some extralinguistic factors were also considered.  For example, plausibility of contact with speakers of the putative donor language; presence of the referent in the environment (or lack thereof); date of introduction of the referent or of the word."", ""fd_effect"": ""Replacement: \n\nSometimes it is relatively easy to tell if a word had existed in Malay before its replacement by a loanword, if the native word is still used in some varieties of Malay-Indonesian.  For example, the original word might still be used in Malaysia but not in Indonesia; or it may be used in very formal or poetic Indonesian only; or it may be found in old literature, but has since become obsolete.  However, there may have been Malay words that were completely replaced by loanwords at an early stage, and left no trace; in such cases, it was not possible to determine whether replacement had taken place.\n\nInsertion: \n\nThis option was chosen in cases where there is good reason to believe that the concept was introduced together with the word for it.\n\nCoexistence: \n\nThis option was chosen when it is known that when the loanword entered language, another word (borrowed or not) had already existed in the language with the same meaning, and this word is still in use.  It is thus a combined diachronic + synchronic designation. \n\nNote: A word was marked with \u2018Replacement\u2019 or \u2018Coexistence\u2019 only if both the original word and the loanword were determined to be exact or near-exact counterparts of the LWT meaning."", ""fd_free_meaning"": ""A meaning is entered if there is a significant difference between the LWT meaning and the Indonesian counterpart, or to explain shades of meaning in case of multiple counterparts of LWT meanings.  Comments on the meaning of the word form are also entered here."", ""fd_analyzability"": ""The criteria used to determine the analyzability of word forms are as follows:\n\nUnanalyzable\n\nThis is chosen when no analysis is possible in modern Indonesian.  This includes:\n\nA. Historically monomorphemic words.\nB. Words which were historically analyzable but are no longer perceived as such by lay speakers, e.g. sembahyang \u2018pray\u2019, historically formed from sembah \u2018worship\u2019 + hiang \u2018deity\u2019.\nC. Reduplicated forms which only occur in a reduplicated form.  For example, kunang-kunang \u2018firefly\u2019 exists only as such; the base *kunang does not occur by itself. \n\nSemi-analyzable\n\nThis is chosen in the following cases:\n\nA. Words whose base does not occur by itself and has no independent meaning (\u2018cranberry morph\u2019); for example, pengemis \u2018beggar\u2019 is derived from the root *kemis (which does not occur by itself with this meaning) + the agentive prefix peng-.\nB. Words that appear to have a root, but also contain phonological material which are neither another root nor an affix.  For example, the form keluar \u2018to go out\u2019 contains the Indonesian root luar \u2018out, outside\u2019, but standard Indonesian does not have a prefix ke- .\nC. Words which were originally monomorphemic, but by metanalysis are now perceived as containing more than one morpheme.  For example, pertama \u2018first\u2019 (from Sanskrit prathama) is perceived to contain the Indonesian prefix per- and a base *tama, which resulted in the derived form pertama-tama \u2018at first\u2019 by reduplicating the perceived base *tama.\nD. Reduplicated forms whose base does occur by itself but which are not derived from the base by any regular process (that is, the meaning of the derived form cannot be predicted).  For example, the base of laki-laki \u2018man\u2019 is laki, does occur by itself with the meaning \u2018husband\u2019, but the meaning of laki-laki cannot be predicted.\nE. A compound one of whose constituents does not occur independently.  For example iri hati \u2018envious\u2019 contains hati \u2018liver\u2019 which often occurs in idiomatic expressions as the seat of emotions (like English \u2018heart\u2019).  However iri by itself has no meaning in modern Indonesian.\nF. Words which are historically polymorphemic but perceived so only by some speakers.  For example, the form perempuan \u2018woman\u2019 is transparently derived from empu \u2018master\u2019 + the noun-deriving circumfix per-an, but most lay speakers do not realize that, and regard the word as monomorphemic.\nG. Words which are historically analyzable and still transparent.  For example lelaki \u2018male\u2019 is transparently derived from laki \u2018husband\u2019 by partial reduplication, yet this is a frozen form, and partial reduplication is no longer productive in standard Indonesian.\n\nAnalyzable derived\n\nThis category contains words derived by reduplication and words that contain affixes.  These affixes include meng- (\u2018active\u2019) and di- (\u2018passive\u2019) when required in standard Indonesian. (See Note 2 under W9 below.)\n\nAnalyzable compound\n\nDetermining which words are compounds is not always a straightforward process in Indonesian.  Words were marked \u2018analyzable compound\u2019 in the following cases.\n\nA. A coordinate compound that, were it a phrase, would require a conjunction, e.g. tanah-air \u2018native country\u2019 (lit. \u2018land-water\u2019); were it a phrase, it would be tanah dan air (land and water). \nB. A sequence of words which could be interpreted as a phrase, but the meaning of the phrase would be different from the intended meaning.  That is, the compositional semantics is not predictable.  For example, rumah sakit (rumah \u2018house\u2019 + sakit \u2018sick\u2019) does not have the predictable meaning \u2018a house that is sick\u2019, but rather means \u2018a hospital\u2019.\nC. Some other expressions that were intuitively deemed to be fixed.  (There are no clear phonological and morphological criteria to distinguish between phrases and compounds in Indonesian.)\n\nAnalyzable phrasal\n\nThis choice was rarely used.   Phrases are not analyzed as lexical entries in Indonesian, unless they consist of idioms.  However, the distinction between \u2018compound\u2019 and \u2018phrase\u2019 was sometimes difficult, and the choice arbitrary."", ""fd_register"": ""This field is filled in for all words.  When the relevant word included one of the prefixes meng- or ber-, the choice of register refers to the base rather than to the entire form, because these two prefixes are by definition formal (except for a handful frozen forms) and mostly obligatory in standard Indonesian."", ""fd_borrowed_base"": ""Notes are provided regarding words which are not loanwords in their entirety but which contain a borrowed element.  If this borrowed element already occurs in the database as a Word Form, a cross-reference is provided."", ""fd_form"": ""The vocabulary does not aim at exhaustion, but most Indonesian words that are reasonably close equivalents of LWT meanings are probably listed.  These include formal words which are rarely used, but appear in Indonesian dictionaries, and are understood by educated speakers.  Such words are often current in standard Malaysian Malay and/or some regional dialects of Malay-Indonesian.  Colloquial words were included if they are also used to some extent in written literature (including journalism).  Some colloquialisms are used throughout Indonesia, but some are specific to Jakarta Indonesian (which is rapidly becoming a lingua franca, including for certain genres of written communication).  Words or forms likely to be used only by natives of Jakarta and not understood in other regions were avoided.\n\nThe word form is cited in standard Indonesian orthography, with one exception.  In the standard orthography, two phonemes are not distinguished: the mid front vowel /e/ and the mid central vowel /\u0259/, which are both spelled <e>.  In this database, the two are distinguished: /e/ is written <\u00e9>, and /\u0259/ is written <e>.  Whenever the pronunciation of a word cannot be transparently inferred from the spelling, a phonemic transcription is provided in \u2018Comments on word form\u2019.\n\nThere are three types of cases when more than one form is listed in the Word form field.  Sometimes a word may be represented by different morphological forms derived from the same root, for example potong / potongan \u2018piece\u2019.  Sometimes there are different phonological forms of the same word, for example mangkuk / mangkok \u2018bowl\u2019.  And sometimes there are alternative spellings of the same word, e.g. cabai / cabe \u2018chili pepper\u2019.  However, in no case were forms representing different etyma (having different roots or bases) entered in the same record.\n\nElements given in parentheses are optional.  For example, gempa (bumi) \u2018the earthquake\u2019 means the Indonesian form is either gempa or gempa bumi; (burung) gagak \u2018crow\u2019 means the form is either gagak or burung gagak.  This is important, because for determining whether a form is classified as a loanword or as containing a borrowed element (W9 and all the fields relating to loanwords), the parenthesized word was ignored.  However, it was taken into consideration for the purpose of determining its analyzability."", ""fd_salience"": ""Very little information is available regarding the presence or absence of certain concepts and entities before contact, especially when the contact was very early.  So often this field was filled with \u2018no information\u2019.  For function words, \u2018Not applicable\u2019 was written in, since grammatical categories and relations cannot be said to present in or absent from the environment."", ""fd_hungarian_translation"": null}",27,Indonesian,,,,1

Contact among some Mayan languages: inferences from loanwords. Anthropological Linguistics 45(1): 57-93."", ""fd_age"": ""For the purpose of the Age field, each node in the Mayan family back to which a word can be traced constitutes the age. These nodes are translated into absolute dates from glottochronological estimates that were produced by Terrence Kaufman in 1968 as cited, without bibliographical reference, in Anonymous 1976. This estimates has advantages over those of Kaufman 1976, where not all nodes are dated (for instance, the breaking off of Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 from K\u2019iche\u2019an is not dated), and where only the time of breakup of languages is given rather than intervals for the existence of some proto-languages. The nodes could be translated into other dates from other estimates (e.g., those used by Brown in his contribution on Tzotzil to the present project). Kaufman\u2019s dates are presumably produced following standard methodology as described in Swadesh\u2019 works. As mentioned, for most nodes Kaufman gives an interval, but for some only a single point in time. For instance, K\u2019iche\u2019an begins 300 BCE and ends 100 BCE, whereas proto-Mayan begins and ends in 2500 BCE. Dates for single current languages correspond to the split from the nearest sister language to the present. For instance, Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 breaks up from K\u2019iche\u2019an in 300 CE and continues to the present. When a word is found in subgroups that are not immediately connected to the same node it is sometimes assumed that it has diffused during the time of the proto-languages, and the date given will then correspond to the interval during which these proto-languages overlap. For geographically non-contiguous groups, however, it is assumed that the word goes back to the latest node connecting the two proto-languages and the age is given accordingly. The age of Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 is normally just given as \u2018Q\u2019eqchi\u2019\u2019, corresponding to 300-2007 CE, but for Spanish borrowings it is possible to make the followings stratification: the treatment of the Spanish s sound as a palatal (e.g., meex for mesa \u2018table\u2019) is seen as evidence for the borrowing as having happened during \u2018Early Colonial Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 (1529-1500 CE). \u2018Colonial Q\u2019eqchi\u2019\u2019 (1529-1800 CE), is used when the reflection of Colonial Spanish phonology and phonetics (xaar for jarro \u2018jug\u2019) or lexicon (meet for the archaic limeta \u2018bottle\u2019) shows this to have been borrowed during this period. Borrowings from colonial times where s is treated as s (son for son \u2018music\u2019) are dated to \u2018Later Colonial Q\u2019eqchi\u2019\u2019 (1550-1800). When the treatment of s as s is the only guide to dating (e.g., iglees < iglesia \u2018church\u2019), borrowings are assigned the label \u2018Later Post-Conquest Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 (1550-2007). When the treatment of the sound spelled \u201cj\u201d as a velar fricative is the only guide (e.g., ob\u2019eja < oveja \u2018lamb\u2019), borrowings are assigned the label \u2018Post-Colonial Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 (1800-2007). We use \u201820th century Q\u2019eqchi\u2019\u2019 (1900-2007 CE) for loanwords whose references to modern objects help in dating the time of borrowing to this period (e.g., teleb\u2019ision). Spanish borrowings that cannot be dated more precisely are assigned the label \u2018Post-Conquest Q\u2019eqchi\u2019 (1529-2007). \n\nReferences\n\nAnonymous. 1976. \u201cAppendix: Historical and geographical sketch of K\u2019ekchi within the Mayan language family; outline grammar of K\u2019ekchi.\u201d In Pinkerton (ed.), 160-168.\n\nFreund, Robert. 1976. \u201cA sketch of K\u2019ekchi verb morphology.\u201d In: Pinkerton (ed.), 26-47.\n\nKaufman, Terrence. 1976. \u201cArchaeological and linguistic correlations in Mayaland and associated areas.\u201d World Archaeology 8(1): 101-18.\n\nPinkerton, Sandra (ed.). 1976.

We verified if the Spanish loanwords already were attested by Urbano in his Arte breve de la lengua Otomi y vocabulario triling\u00fce from 1605. And we asked several elder native speakers of Otom\u00ed if the Spanish loanwords were borrowed after around 1950 or if they already were used before that year. So we classified the loanwords in three groups:\na. Spanish words attested by Urbano\nb. Pre-modern words borrowed before around 1950\nc. Modern words borrowed after around 1950"", ""fd_borrowed"": ""According to the degree of probability that a specific word is a loanword, words might be classified in five types (0. no evidence for borrowing; 1. very little for borrowing; 2. perhaps borrowed; 3. probably borrowed; 4. clearly borrowed). Because of our familiarity with the Otom\u00ed language for most of the 1459 entries in the LWT vocabulary it was easy to determine if a word was a loanword or not, even for old loanwords such as anxe, ata, badu, xabo, xebo, etc., which are more adjusted to the phonological patterns of Otom\u00ed than the recent loanwords. So almost all the entries of our wordlist belong to type 0 (no evidence for borrowing) or type 4 (clearly borrowed)."", ""fd_contact_situation"": ""Otomi was the native language of the old inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico and its surrounding valleys. Throughout history its speakers had to confront the Aztecs, Spaniards and Mestizos, speakers of Nahuatl and Spanish.\uf020 Since the Otomis had to surrender to the speakers of Nahuatl from the 15th century onwards, there has been a very close contact between the Otomi and Nahuatl languages. However, Otom\u00ed has adopted very few Nahuatl borrowings. \nWhen the Spaniards arrived at the beginning of the 16th century, the Otomis were the second most numerous group after the Nahuas on the highlands. Therefore, the Spaniards were strongly interested in converting them to Catholicism. Despite the fact that the language was considered very difficult because of its complex vowel and consonant system, a spelling system for Otomi was developed and grammars, vocabularies, catechisms and legal documents were written in it. Fray Alonso Urbano (1605) wrote a trilingual Arte breve de la lengua Otomi y vocabulario triling\u00fce, espa\u00f1ol-Otomi-n\u00e1huatl, which is an important source for early loans. \nAfter the Independence of Mexico in 1813 major changes occurred in the indigenous community. The indigenous groups, which were officially recognized under Spanish rule, didn\u2019t have that position any more. As a result of this, the indigenous languages lost their status, and Otomi was no longer written by the civil authorities, only by a handful of scholars. Thus, it was in the nineteenth century that a process of language shift started. \nThe Mexican Revolution (1911-1917) did not result in social change for the indigenous population, nor did it foster more recognition of their language or stopped language shift. On the contrary, after a long history in which they have been degraded socially little by little, the Otomis now belong to the lowest social levels of the Mexican society, as is the case for many other indigenous groups in Mexico. They dwell in the most remote and less fertile places on the highlands, reason why many of them have chosen to emigrate to the bigger towns. \nDuring the last 50 years, because of the construction of roads and schools, the growing influence of the media, trade and emigration, contact between the Otomis and the Spanish speaking Mestizos has increased dramatically. As a result, a rapid increase in contact phenomena, such as the increasing use of Spanish loanwords, is observed in the respective varieties of Otomi.""}",35,Otomi,,,,1
36,"{""fd_age"": ""The ages were generally enumerated into descriptive categories of lexical strata to which specific years were assigned to at a later stage, with the year spans for different strata completely over-lapping in some cases. This provides a relatively coarse-grained view of the ages of the various lexical items in the database. Some words, undoubtedly, could be given more precise ages, but such work was not attempted here. Age spans were all rounded to fifty-year intervals so as not to give any mistaken impressions of precision for their beginning and end points."", ""fd_borrowed"": ""The following describes the general criteria which were used to assign a word to a particular Borrowed status. An effort was made to make sure that there was some consistency to the way these categories were employed, but there was necessarily also a degree of subjective assessment as well. The descriptions as to how each category was used will cover most words, but, of course, they all \u201cleak\u201d to some degree.\n\nClearly borrowed: \n\nGenerally, I classified a word as clearly borrowed if (i) it did not seem possible to propose a reasonable English etymology for the word and (ii) it was possible to propose a  non-English etymology for the word which was a good match for the relevant Saramaccan word both formally and semantically. When a word did not meet these criteria but was still classified as clearly borrowed, a justification for this will generally have been given in the Comments on Borrowed field. The most common reason for such exceptions was when there was an imperfect, but still good, formal and semantic match of a Saramaccan word with a word of Afri-can origin, since available sources on the relevant African languages are limited and the lack of a better match could easily be due to gaps in documentation.\n\nProbably borrowed: \n\nGenerally, a word was classified as probably borrowed when there was a good proposal for a non-English etymology for the word, but there were (i) important open questions about either the quality of the proposed etymology on formal or semantic grounds or (ii) there was a competing English etymology which seemed unlikely but which I could not rule out entirely. In most cases, there should be a comment in the Comments on Borrowed field briefly explaining the nature of the problems resulting in this classification.\n\nPerhaps borrowed: \n\nSome words given this classification, broadly speaking, were similar to words in the probably borrowed class except the nature of the relevant problems was more significant either because there was more than one distinct kind of notable problem (for example, issues with both the formal and semantic match for the proposed source word) or because one single problem raised particularly significant issues (for example, the semantic match may have been especially tenuous). Another class of words given this classification involved compounds (and other polymorphemic structures) composed of two elements from the same non-English source language (e.g., Gbe languages or Portuguese) where I had no evidence indicating whether the relevant complex structure was formed internally to Saramaccan or if it was borrowed as a unit. In most cases, there should be a comment in the Comments on Borrowed field briefly explaining the nature of the relevant problems.\n\nVery little evidence for borrowing: \n\nThe majority of the words in this class are cases where there is no clear English or non-English etymology for the word. Since, the Saramaccan lexicon is assumed here to have branched off of the English lexicon, any word without a clear English etymology is a candidate as a loanword. However, the lack of an English etymology is weak evidence for borrowing, especially given that we can expect that Saramaccan would have formed some new words completely internally. For this class of words, there will be a comment in the Other Comments  field explaining this briefly. Another class of words in this category were those that had a good English etymology but where another etymology (e.g., Dutch or Sranan) also seemed possible, but relatively unlikely. In most cases, there should be a comment in the Comments on Borrowed or Other Comments  field briefly explaining this.\n\nNo evidence for borrowing: \n\nAs discussed in the Saramaccan chapter, for the purposes of this vocabulary, the Saramaccan lexicon is viewed as a highly divergent variant of the English lexicon. Accordingly, monomorphemic words with good English etymologies are considered to give no evidence for borrowing (except, of course, for words for relatively modern concepts). In addition, for the most part, morphologically analyzable words (including compounds) are generally considered to offer no evidence for borrowing unless there is specific evidence indicating they are not the result of word-formation processes within Saramaccan."", ""fd_hungarian_translation"": null, ""fd_reference"": ""Bruyn, Adrienne. 2002. \u201cThe structure of the Surinamese creoles\u201d.

37,"{""fd_age"": ""The ages are characterized with reference to the landmarks of each period which include sociopolitical events and the publication of grammatical descriptions and dictionaries. The dates of the periods should be taken only as approximate references and a great degree of overlapping is expected. Each period represents a stage in the development of Imbabura Quechua (Quichua). The formative period represents the stage of Proto-Quechua, i.e. the common ancestor of all Quechua languages. From central Peru this language expanded gradually to the north and the south and became later to be used as a lingua franca by groups of distinct linguistic origin. This period, however, has not been included in the age field of the database. As Quechua was not autochthonous to Ecuador but was brought from the south, the Pre-Inca is the first period of Imbabura Quichua. The Pre-Inca period corresponds to the diffusion of the Chinchay variety of Quechua to the area of today\u2019s Ecuador and the use thereof as a lingua franca in the region. The Inca period corresponds to the second entry of Quechua to the northern Andes through the Incas, who ruled the peoples of today\u2019s Ecuador for nearly sixty years (1470-1532) until the death of Atahualpa by the Spaniards. In this period Quechua became established as an official language and used accordingly by the local elites and the Inca rulers. The period labeled as \u2018Early Colonial\u2019 extends from the conquest of the northern Andes by the Spaniards nearly to the publication of the first known written record of Ecuadorian Quichua. This period is characterized by the Quichuicization of the peoples of the northern Andes by missionaries, who used the Inca language for evangelization and other purposes. The Pre-Inca languages are known to be spoken until the end of this period along with Quichua. The Late Colonial period knows the appearance of the first written records in Ecuadorian Quichua, two of which are of religious nature (a pastoral letter and a religions instruction) and a wordlist.  In this period the lexical and grammatical features of Ecuadorian Quichua as it is known today become established. This period knows the beginning of the hacienda system and the abandonment of Quichua as a means of instruction of native peoples in favor of Spanish. The Early Republic period extends throughout the nineteenth century and knows the publication of the first grammar of Quichua along other literary texts. The final period, Contemporary, corresponds to the twentieth century and extends to the present. It features an aggressive Hispanicization of the Quichua-speaking population as a result of labor migration to the cities and the urbanization of the countryside. This period knows the largest influence from the official language (Spanish) on Imbabura Quichua."", ""fd_contact_situation"": ""Pre-Inca languages to Quichua: Quichua was spoken in the northern Andes (Imbabura) before the Inca invasion as a lingua franca. It was brought by mindal\u00e1es (long-distance traders) from the Peruvian region of Chinchay and was used by different ethnic groups. The native languages of these groups included at least five autochthonous languages, of which little is known except for several lists of words. Still, some of them continued to be spoken until the second half of the seventeenth century. The influence of these language on Imbabura Quichua is expected from a context of bilingualism as the one prevailing in the pre-Inca and Inca periods. The pre-Inca language spoken in today\u2019s province of Imbabura was known as Cara or Caranqui, the linguistic affiliation of which has been disputed over the years though most scholars agree that its origin is Barbacoan \u2013 and therefore affiliated with other languages of southern Colombia such as Pasto or Sibundoy. The sociolinguistic situation of the northern Andes in pre-Inca times was one of multilingualism in which ethnic groups of different linguistic backgrounds spoke Quechua as a means of inter-ethnic communication and commerce. \n\nPeruvian Quechua to Ecuadorian Quechua (Quichua): Quechua entered the northern Andes several times and through different channels: first, through long-distance traders from Chinchay in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries as explained above; second, through the Inca rulers from Cuzco and their army between 1470 to 1532; and through mitimaes (peoples uprooted from their traditional homeland and re-settled in different parts of the Inca empire for political reasons). Each of these groups influenced the configuration of Imbabura Quichua in different degrees. While the Quechua variety from Chinchay provided the lexical and grammatical basis of Imbabura Quichua, the Cuzco variety exerted a decisive influence on the lexical configuration thereof for two reasons: Cuzco Quechua was not only the official language of the empire but also the prestigious variety associated with the Inca.  Other Peruvian varieties such as Huanca and Cajamarca Quechua seem to have exerted only a minor influence on Imbabura Quichua though their presence can be traced also in the lexicon. \n\nAymara to Quichua \nThe influence of Aymara on Imbabura Quechua is but minor if compared to that of Spanish or other Peruvian Quechua varieties. The presence of Aymara mitimaes has been claimed for the northern Andes, but the development of this population in Ecuador has not satisfactorily explained so far. Most probably Aymara entered Imbabura Quichua either through Cuzco Quichua or other Peruvian varieties with which it was in direct contact. The presence of soldiers from different parts of the Inca empire, many of which may have had Aymaran linguistic background, might explain the presence of Aymara words in the lexicon of Imbabura Quichua. However, no intensive or long-term coexistence of both languages in the northern Andes leads us to suspect any major influence on the configuration of Imbabura Quichua.\n\nBarbacoan languages to Quichua: \nApart from Cara (extinct), other Barbacoan languages with which Imbabura Quichua has been in contact for their geographical proximity are Tsafiki and Awapit, both vigorously spoken in southwest and northwest Imbabura. The contact with speakers of these languages is null today, however. Still, it is possible that trade networks among speakers of the three linguistic groups in the past allowed some minor Barbacoan influence on Imbabura Quichua. \n\nSpanish to Quichua:  Of the languages in contact with Imbabura Quichua, Spanish is by far the most influencing language due to the intensive long-term contact of Quichua speakers with the dominant Spanish-speaking society in a diglossic situation. Of the Quichua-speaking provinces of Ecuador, Imbabura shows the highest level of Quichua-Spanish bilingualism along with higher levels of Quichua maintenance. This makes Imbabura different from other highland provinces where bilingualism is also important. The match of bilingualism and maintenance has led to intensive linguistic borrowing from Spanish but also to two other associated phenomenon: 1) code-switching between Quichua and Spanish; 2) the development of a mixed variety known as Media Lengua."", ""fd_reference"": ""Catta Quellen, Xavier (1994).

39,"{""fd_age"": ""The limited data and lack of any text record has made the dating of words in the database difficult.  Relative dates were established using several criteria.  First, comparison of word lists across the Nadahup family, and particularly the reconstructions in Martins (2005), were used to determine whether a given word was cognate across two or more Nadahup languages (and thus appears to reconstruct to Proto-Nadahup, Proto-Hup-Yuhup-D\u00e2w, etc.); however, these lists included only a fraction of the words in the database, and intra-family borrowing cannot always be ruled out.  Other words, particularly loanwords of Portuguese origin, are dated within a general range of 100 to 10 years ago, on the basis of their formal accommodation and the best guess at when the concept became known to Hup speakers generally (for example, Hup speakers obtained items like knives and axes through trade long before they entered into direct contact with non-Indians, whereas other things like ice, wheat bread, and canned beer are very recent and still rarely encountered). \n\tThe numerical dates assigned to these relative periods are very approximate and should be understood as little more than wild guesses.  For example, the age of Proto-Nadahup is given at between -500 and 1200 CE, but even this wide range could be incorrect if the rate of change in the Vaup\u00e9s is significantly slower or faster than that of other better-understood language families, such as Romance.  The age of many words in the database is indicated as \u2018no information\u2019; this simply means that the Hup words have no known cognates, which is in most cases due to an unavailability of lexical data on all three sister languages is unavailable for that meaning.  Since the Hup data itself is only a few years old, a date of \u2018since 2000 CE\u2019 for the first attestation of these words seems pointless, so no date is given."", ""fd_borrowed"": ""Determining the likelihood of borrowing and the immediate sources of loans was constrained by the information available.

The loanword status of many Hup words in the database is thus given as \u2018no evidence for borrowing\u2019 where no Tukanoan form was available for comparison (except in the few cases where there was some other indication that the word might be borrowed).  Without a good documentation of Portuguese loans into Tukano, it was also impossible in many cases to determine whether borrowings of Portuguese origin in Hup entered via Tukano or directly from Portuguese.  The lack of detailed lexical data on Hup\u2019s sister languages also made intra-family comparison difficult.\nGiven these limitations, the likelihood of borrowing from Tukano was determined by the following criteria.  If a Tukano word nearly identical in form and meaning to the Hup word could be identified (e.g. Hup b\u01d0/ and Tukano bi/i \u2018rat/mouse\u2019), the degree of certainty was rated 3 (\u2018probably borrowed\u2019) or 4 (\u2018clearly borrowed\u2019), depending on the closeness of the match, intuitions of consultants, and whether information was available on the form of the word in Hup\u2019s sister languages (i.e. indications that the word is not cognate were considered additional evidence of loanword status).  The degree of certainty decreased where the word form and meaning were only an approximate match (e.g. Hup p\u00ed/ and Tukano y\u00e3pi \u2018potato\u2019), to 3 or 2 (\u2018possibly borrowed\u2019) if Hup\u2019s sister languages had unrelated forms, and to 2 or 1 (\u2018very little evidence\u2019) where there was no comparative information available on the word in the other Nadahup languages.  Finally, while existing data and the current sociolinguistic situation suggest that the direction of borrowing was consistently Tukanoan > Hup rather than vice versa, the absence of good comparative data on the Tukanoan and Nadahup families has made this impossible to establish definitively in every case."", ""fd_hungarian_translation"": null, ""fd_reference"": ""All Hup data comes my fieldwork (2000-2004).\n\nTukano: \nRamirez, Henri. 1997.

The year 1606, following the publication of the first grammar of this language (Valdivia 1606), is the earliest milestone in Mapudungun documentation. All the words and loanwords that Valdivia collected have been labeled Pre-1606. This category includes most of the Quechua loans, which were introduced prior to Spanish colonization (1536), or immediately afterwards. All Spanish loanwords concerning national institutions and the constitution of citizenship, such as schools, hospitals, the post office, health, and armed forces recruitment, can be traced to 1884, following the final defeat of the Mapuche peoples in Chile and Argentina, and the incorporation of the survivors into national society.
