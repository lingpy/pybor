In order to bring the Islamic faith to the Berbers, special religious vocabulary was designed. As these terms are found all over Berber, and both with groups adhering to Sunnite and to Kharijite Islam, this vocabulary must have been introduced at a time when the Islamic schism was not yet a major issue in Berber country. This suggests a time before or during the Kharijite predominance in Northern Africa, i.e. in the eighth century CE or earlier.

88,,cs-9129144971569139,Chinese contact [30],"In 1852, plantation owners in Hawai’i began recruiting contract laborers from China. Just over 2,000 Chinese were recorded in Hawai’i in 1875, the year in which the Reciprocity Treaty was signed between the Kingdom of Hawai’i and the United States of America, allowing free trade between these two countries. New labor was sought to meet the growing US demand for Hawaiian sugar. A further 37,000 Chinese were therefore imported into Hawai’i a.s plantation labor. Chinese professionals and merchants arrived later, after Hawaii's annexation to the USA in 1898. Contract labor was legally abolished in 1900, although foreign laborers continued to arrive on the plantations. 
All of the Chinese plantation workers came from the province of Guangdong (formerly Kwangtung) and spoke Hakka and Cantonese. In practice, the Hawaiian Dictionary (Pukui and Elbert 1986) makes no distinction between Hakka and Cantonese loanwords. In a single case, a lonnword has been identified as ‘‘Informal Cantones’’ (W15): i.e., Hawaiian Pake ‘Chinese’ (< Informal Cantonese baak3 ‘father’s older brother’).

One entice¬ment for American annexation was Hawai‘I’s strategic position in the Pacific.

Like other plantation workers, many Japanese settled in Hawai¬ian cities after completing their contracts, which would have been for five or three years. Connections between Hawai‘i and Japan remain strong, as Japanese tourists constitute a major tourist presence in the Islands. Four words in the database have been identified as Japanese loanwords: mochi ‘sticky rice cake’ (< mochi); musubi ‘rice ball’ (< musubi); ‘eka‘eka ‘Japanese taro’ (< adado); and koiu ‘soy sauce’ (< sho-yu).",,1,,1
92,,cs-9129144265081274,Lexicon Committee [30],"Hawaiian language immersion schools emerged in the 1980s, as part of the cultural revival inspired in part by the Civil Rights movement in America. These schools would develop new pedagogic materials for primary and secondary curricula. With the final edition of Pukui and Elbert’s Hawaiian Dictionary in 1986, however, a lexicographic void was created. By 1987, this void was already being addressed by the Komike Hua‘olelo, or ‘Lexicon Committee’. Although the Komike  Hua‘olelo’s membership changes, it typically includes teachers, scholars, and other Hawaiian language experts front across the Islands. In terms of content, the Komike Hua‘olelo’s dictionary stands in complementary distribution with Pukui and Elbert's dictionary, adding new terminology like Punauwele Puni Honua ‘Internet’ (a calque of ‘World Wide Web’). 
As noted by Schütz (1994), the Komike Hua‘olelo favors loanwords from Polynesian or other endangered languages over loanwords from English. This is a con¬scious response to the dominance of English in Hawai‘i, as students are strongly exposed to English outside school. Since the vocabulary in Komike Hua‘olelo 2003 has been influenced by an educated and formally assembled committee, it is important to distinguish words suggested by the Komike Hua‘olelo from words borrowed in other contact situations, even if they are ultimately borrowed from the same source (e.g., French). Also, some of the vocabulary in Komike Hua‘olelo 2003 appears to have been invented by the committee rather than recorded in natural use, although this is hard to judge because the Komike Hua‘olelo provides little documentation of its deliberations. It. should be noted in fairness, however, that the Komike Hua‘olelo has a very specific purpose (i.e., developing pedagogical vocabulary) which it accomplishes very well, as the thriving Hawaiian revitalization attests. Komike Hua‘Olelo 2003 records words from: Assyrian. Czech, English, French. Japanese. Maori, Rarotongan, Tahitian, and Ute. Unfortunately, since the Komike Hua‘olelo does not always cite source words, and I have not had time to check them all, there are some guesses in the database which I should like to flag. These are indicated with question marks (showing uncertainty), as in the Rarotongan source word for ma‘aka ‘upper case’ (< Rarotongan ma'aka?).",,1,,1

93,,cs-9129144502819386,Missionary Bible translation [30],"Missionaries arrived in Hawai'i in 1820, bringing with them their New England ideals of education, literacy, and religion. They eventually devised a workable Hawaiian orthography, and began producing reading material in the Hawaiian language. Foremost amongst their products was a translation of the Bible. This required developing a number of new Hawaiian words for Biblical characters, animals, and so forth. Although in many cases they borrowed words from English into Hawaiian, they did not always do so, borrowing words from classical languages as well. Thus the modern Hawaiian vocabulary contains words like himeni 'song' (< English hymn), nahesa 'snake' (< Hebrew nahas), 'aeko 'eagle' (< Church Latin aetos), and 'alopeka 'fox' (< Greek alopeks). Why did the missionaries borrow vocabulary from these classical languages? In some cases, the missionaries' puritan ideals were involved. For example, meli 'honey' was loaned from Greek rather than from English, because, as Schütz (1976: 79) explains: ""Honi 'kiss' and hani 'act flirtatious' would have given an undesired risque meaning to such phrases as 'land overflowing with milk and honey' (especially with 'milk' translated by a phrase that means 'breast liquid') or 'lips of a strange woman drop honey'."" In building the database, it was not always easy to guess when an English loanword should be categorized as Missionary or not. In many cases, there are missionary loans from English that were probably left out of the database. On the other hand, the loanwords front the classical languages are easy enough to identify, and they are probably fairly reliably classified as Missionary loans.",,1,,1

For instance, Puerto Rican and Spanish immigrants to Hawaii have typically been subsumed under the Portuguese presence.

During this time, a flourishing Japanese literature emerged, even though Chinese remained the language of administration all the time until the Edo Period (1604-1868). It is assumed that bilingualism among the nobility quickly waned, being replaced by a diglossia type of situation with Classical Chinese as the language of administration and other formal matters, but with Japanese used in all other situations. Indeed, this situation became even more complicated, with the written Japanese of the Heian period as another type being regarded as the language of high literature by later periods as opposed to the spoken vernacular. As for the Chinese, a bewildering number of different styles emerged (Habein 1984, and Hentai kanbun), some even read in a Japanese word order, by way of diacritical marks. Thus, even after the decline of bilingualism among the elite, the role of Chinese in Japanese society remained important, which resulted in a steady stream of loanwords incorporated into the Japanese language.

The cultural exchange deepens with the rising number of immigrants from China and Korea, who introduce the Chinese script to Japan in the 4th century CE. In the 6th century CE Buddhism arrives in Japan, and vast Chinese-style reforms are instituted in 646. By the time of the Nara period (710-794), the sinicisation of the Japanese had reached its height and most of the Japanese elite had become bilingual in Japanese and Chinese and were also sent to China for study. The first extant written records in Japan date from the 8th century and are almost exclusively written in Chinese, with the exception of poems and ritual texts. Words that have found their way into the Japanese lexicon in this period (corresponding to Old Japanese and Late Old Japanese in the Age field), are classified in this category. The Sino-Japanese prounciation reflects the Chinese standard of these times: the first type of onyomi, called go’on, is based on the language of Chinese states south of the Yangzi River, and was primarily used during the Nara Period. The  second one, called kan’on, is based on the language of Sui and Tang, whose capitals were in the North of China, in Chang’an and Luoyang and was used during the Heian period. The fact that most Sino-Japanese readings are now kan’on does not mean that the majority of words from that era was borrowed during the Heian period, but rather that due to the still active bilingualism the Japanese switched from using a Souther Chinese variant to a Northern one.

Most of the Russian loanwords from this stratum have been borrowed before the resettlement of the Skolt Saami to Finland in 1940, which is confirmed by the occurrence of cognate forms in the modern Skolt Saami dictionaries of Mosnikoff & Sammallahti (1988) and Sammallahti & Mosnikoff (1991).",,1,,1

As the Dutch delegation was confined to an offshore artificial island in Nagasaki, official contact was extremely limited, with a handful of local interpreter families being the only group of Japanese officially allowed to learn Dutch, but after the relaxation of the ban on the import of European books in 1720, a number of Western texts, especially from medicine, found their way into the country, leading to the establishment of an academic discipline called rangaku “Dutch studies”.  Since ships from other European countries were not allowed to call in Japanese port, contact was limited to chance encounters. However, in order to better defend itself against the growing pressure to open up the country, the shogunate imported some weapons from France at the beginning of the 19th century, which was the leading military power of the time. Umegaki (1963:70f) mentions some French advisers brought in, possibly through Dutch mediation, as the Netherlands was under French occupation from 1795-1813.

Especially after the Korean states of Paekche and Koguryō were invaded by other states in the 7th and 8th century CE, a lot of highly-skilled and Chinese-educated refugees from these states came to Japan, where they played an important role at the court and were able to maintain a high status due to their skills, quickly intermarrying with the Japanese aristocracy. Later on, during the sinicization of the state during the Nara period (710-794), some of them occupied important posts at the court. It is assumed that due to their quick integration they underwent rapid language shift from Korean to Japanese, but due to fact that most of the written records were in Chinese, the exact circumstances are unclear. Only borrowings from these periods offer some evidence for the Korean influence of that time. Often cited term include the name for Nara itself, which is said to come from the Korean nara “land”, and tera “temple”. There was no large-scale immigration from Korea until recent times, when  Japan colonised and annexed Korea  in 1905/1910.

Also, trade with China continued as well, even during the time of extreme isolation of sakoku, Chinese traders were allowed to trade in Nagasaki. More recent loans, from the 19th and 20th centuries, have mainly been related to food as well (rāmen, wantan) and are clearly perceived as foreign words, not Chinese words.

Thus, during the early Meiji era, the modernization efforts were in the hand of a small group of bilingual speakers, leading to an influx of loans from various European languages. This later changed as the government increased its standardization efforts establishing a lot of Sino-Japanese terms. However, the influence of European languages never waned, and even though the vast majority of the population never became bilingual, new borrowings spread.

The meaning of some words diverged considerably and a small number of words appears to have been coined in Japan as well (which is largely based on negative evidence). When Japan was forcibly opened up by Western powers around the mid-19th century, the old traditional structures of the shogunate gave way to the new rule of the Emperor, who proclaimed the Meiji era in 1868. Under his rule, Japan sent out students to various Western countries and invited scholars from Western countries in order to learn from their advanced technologies and scientific knowledge.  Japan was able modernize within quite a short period of time, much earlier than China due to its smaller size and relative geographic remoteness. While during the early Meiji period, a lot of direct borrowing took place, this gave way to a more distinct bilingual setting later as the group of bilinguals, even though influential, always remained small. Official attempts at standardization furthered the use of the traditional Sino-Japanese material to express the variety of new concepts and objects that were brought into the Japanese culture. While some old terms from Classical texts were reused to express new concepts (for instance kagaku科学 “science”, was taken from an expression referring to the various disciplines aspirants had to study to sit for the entrance exams of Imperial China, kējŭ zhi xué 科挙之学), a lot of new terms were coined using the Sino-Japanese material available to the educated Japanese elite. For words in this category, I have a somewhat different approach depending on whether the words were first attested before the Meiji era or afterwards. For the former, I have only included them, if there are is no corresponding word in Chinese; in the case of the latter, if the word can be associated with the cultural domain of Westernization, and there is no positive evidence that the word in question was in use in Chinese prior to that, I have still assumed them to be Japanese coinages.

Contacts with Creoles decrease, and speakers attitudes towards those languages change too. Mastering French is more or less seen as a key for social success (for work, studies, and implication in the political and administrative structures). Today, bilingualism with French is widespread for Kali’na speakers. It is worthwhile to note that nowadays, those language contacts take place in a context of wider plurilingualism. Migrations of the late 20th century triggered a rise of Surinamese Creoles near the western border of the department. 
A finer analysis of the contact situations is in progress, since the sociolinguistic situation was not well known and the present-day situation is quite different. Looking now towards the future, the borrowings we have been dealing with do not constitute a closed set. While the same processes are still in progress, several elements also show that, as the socio-cultural pressure and multilingualism are getting stronger, the languages enter a new phase in their contact history: examples of nonce-borrowings and code-switching are numerous, and let us foresee other interesting types of contact-induced changes.",,1,,1

168,,cs-9221226862279268,Increasing Germanization [10],"Generally, this contact situation can be characterized by increasing Germanization. The last Sorbian tribes lost their political independence at the beginning of the 11th century (1003), followed by a long process of establishing German-ruled territories. There was a small class of German rulers whereas the great majority (about 90%) of the rural population was Sorbian. Since the 12th century the colonization of the Sorbian-speaking territory was forced by an increasing settlement of German farmers, craftsmen and merchants. This process – in combination with further Christian missionary activity and often with economic and technical superiority of the newcomers – generally led to a stepwise assimilation of the Sorbian population and therefore to a shrinking of their language territory. Another consequence of this process was a broader and much more intensive language contact leading to an increasing number of German borrowings in Sorbian, mainly since the 14th and 15th century. Intensive borrowing from German into Lower Sorbian was also caused by the Reformation since 1517. An important factor in this process was the formation of a Lower Sorbian literary language, which was closely connected with the Reformation. Mainly in the second half of the 19th century a non-religious literary language evolved. The only weekly newspaper (since 1848) clearly shows the efforts to handle the necessary opening of the language to new topics. Correspondingly we find a great amount of loanwords, some of them new for sure, others probably already known in the dialects, but registered for the first time. Most of the texts in this newspaper were written by the editors, who were bilingual, but mainly German-educated pastors and schoolmasters. In the first decades of this newspaper there is a clear dominance of German with respect to lexical innovations (loanwords or loan translations).",,1,,1

Whereas the Lower Sorbian dialects remained relatively stable the literary language was strongly affected by this group of (Upper Sorbian native) speakers, who first had to learn Lower Sorbian. From this time we observe not only borrowings but also interference, incomplete learning and other effects that are caused by non-native speakers.",,1,,1

In Lower Lusatia this process began later and was also less intensive so that Upper Sorbian became a model for the development of the Lower Sorbian lexicon.

It is often impossible to identify the exact source of Sabaki loanwords due to the similarity between Swahili and Comorian languages in general, and among the Comorian languages in particular as well as to the fact that Swahili loanwords themselves may also be of Comorian provenance, as Swahili was a court language in the Comoros in the 19th century. There is strong evidence that the early Austronesian migrants to Madagascar stayed on the African mainland before they finally settled in Madagascar itself, which had no Bantu population prior to their arrival.

180,,cs-9129144717671263,Contact with English [17],"Because of tourist-economy factors, English has begun to spread rather sporadically as a minor lingua franca in Manang, due to the linguistic diversity represented by the trekkers (with language origins like Spanish, German, Dutch, French, Korean, Japanese, etc.). In most cases, basic business transactions between the tourists and Manange lodge or shopkeepers occur in English, with occasional bits of Nepali added. In general, the presence of English is limited enough that it has not had a significant influence on the structure of Manange (at least those Mananges living in the Manang District), but there does seem to have been the introduction of a handful of English words into the Manange lexicon (without obviously traveling via Nepali), including plate, candy, pipe, petrol, government, and silk. At least one of these, ʃilik ‘silk’, co-occurs with another (Nepali) loan, resham. In most cases, unless their is evidence otherwise, it is observed the influence of English is currently limited enough such that even loanwords that share a stronger-than-chance phonological similarity with English are assumed to be borrowed via Nepali, and not directly from English (e.g. Manange sʌpi ‘soap’ is assumed to be a loan from Nepali sop, even though it is probably a loanword in Nepali from English).",,1,,1
181,,cs-9129144502950285,Contact with Nepali [17],"The history of language contact in Nepal is complex, and the results of this long-term inter-mingling of languages have had varying consequences on typological and genealogical features of different Tibeto-Burman languages located there. Noonan 2003b) charts the different types of grammatical borrowing in a number of Tibeto-Burman languages from different sub-phyla. Of the three main types of contact scenarios, the oldest situation is between Himalayish languages (including Kiranti, Kham, Magar, Chepang, Newar, and others), whose speakers have been long-time residents of Nepal. A more recent type of contact is between speakers of the Tibetan-type languages of the Bodish sub-group, including Manange (i.e. within-family contact). These peoples are more recent immigrants to Nepal, having migrated within the last two millennia, and occupying territories that are in close proximity. A still more recent, and different, type of contact situation in Nepal has been between speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages and Indo-Aryan languages, especially Nepali. Although Nepali was already well-established in western Nepal, there has been more recent contact of this third type in eastern and central Nepal. Now, as the influence of Nepali (and perhaps English) spreads throughout Nepal, cross-family contact is as (or more) likely as within-family contact.; In 1956, David Snellgrove, of the School of Oriental and African Studies, undertook a six month journey through Nepal to update map information originating from the Survey of India and to study Buddhist art and scriptures.  He spent some time in the Manang District, and his observations provide an interesting take on the Manange language and society at that time. Snellgrove was initially intrigued by the lack of surprise displayed by Mananges when they first encountered him. He also noted that Manange youths “spoke Nepali willingly and fluently” (1961: 205). Added to this, Snellgrove noticed silks from mainland China and Singapore adorning the walls of local gompa buildings, suggesting some trade-oriented contact with other Asian peoples. Snellgrove soon learned that Mananges had significantly more contact with the world beyond the Nepalese borders than did many other indigenous groups, holding posts in the Indian Army and having unique travel rights to Malaysia and Singapore. Snellgrove’s observations are anecdotal evidence that the (intermittent) contact between Manange and other non-Bodish languages has been occurring for a long time.; In recent generations, it has become commonplace for many Mananges to migrate temporarily or permanently to the Kathmandu valley, or to lower elevations within Manang or Lamjung Districts during winter, to benefit from longer growing seasons and less harsh climates. In winters, women and children especially, stay in low elevation villages where Nepali is spoken, and men may travel to other regions in Nepal or to India (or beyond) for work (Rogers 2004). Although some people do remain in Manang year-round, this number seems to be declining as the years go by.  As a result, for part of the year, many Mananges are surrounded by, and use, Nepali either in urban Kathmandu or in other lower elevation villages in Manang where Nepali-speaking communities (mainly Nepali-speaking Chhetris and Brahmans) are also located. ; Another relevant factor for contemporary Manange language contact with Nepali is education (Hildebrandt 2003; 2004b). There is one school in each larger Manang village nowadays, and instruction is in Nepali (in fact, most schoolmasters in these schools do not speak the local languages). In addition, a number of adults who live in Manang (traditionally men, but increasingly women too) have had some education either in Kathmandu or abroad. These opportunities for formal education have lead to frequent and long-term contact with other languages, especially Nepali, Hindi and increasingly, English.; In the past twenty-five years or so, Manang has become something of a “tourist hot-spot” because the popular trekking route known as the “Annapurna Long Circuit” bisects the district. A tourist-driven economy has consequently emerged in Manang where wealthy Mananges build elaborate trekking lodges to host (mostly foreign) trekkers. Other related tourist-oriented businesses have grown in the area, including guided tour operations, porter services, trekking-gear shops, and even a solar-powered cyber-cafe, open in the main village of Manang during the high season. Some aspects of this new economy are grounded in Nepali language use (e.g. interaction with tour guides and porters), and so the economic benefit of speaking Nepali has grown there.; Not all Mananges benefit equally from this new tourist-oriented economy. Many Mananges still live traditional, subsistence-farming and husbandry-oriented lives, sometimes simply because they live in areas that are too far off the main trekking route to benefit from the tourist industry in the way that more strategically located residents can. These Mananges claim to use Nepali only sometimes, (e.g. with outside visitors), and speak Manange in all other situations.; The end result is that Nepali loans make up the majority of borrowings in this database, with over 90% of identified loanwords of Indic origin. These include words spanning multiple semantic fields, including words for the physical world, animals, food items, parts of the body, clothing and personal items, religion, and the modern world.",,1,,1

The traditionally nomadic Oroqen relied on the sedentary Dagur for certain agricultural goods, while in exchange supplying the Dagur with pelts and meat.  The commercial relationship, while mutually beneficial, established Dagur as the dominant language, and it became the norm for Oroqen speakers to learn to speak Dagur, resulting in the borrowing of not only lexical items but certain grammatical structures as well. ; ; Both the Dagur and the Oroqen are believed to originate from the region north of the Amur River in present day Russia.

184,,cs-9129144821938684,Contact with Tibetan or other Bodish languages [17],"Certain Tibetan-speaking groups (e.g. Lhomi speakers) and other Manang peoples (e.g. Nar-Phu speakers) recently immigrated to the Manang villages. They have come to Manang in search of better economic opportunity; they rent vacated (Manange-owned) houses and farm the land in a kind of share-cropping situation. Mananges report that these new residents adopt Manange for local use, or else use Nepali. My own (limited) interaction with these people has been in the Manange language, and not in their traditional languages, nor in Nepali. The phonological similarity and shared history of most meanings in Tibeto-Burman makes pinpointing loanwords a difficult task, and as a result, there are only a couple of words in this database suspected as possible Tibetan borrowings (coded under ‘perhaps borrowed’ in the database), including a directional word and a couple of suspected words relating to human states/conditions.; One speculation about the source of these suspected Tibetan borrowings could be the ongoing use of Tibetan in liturgical environments, as Buddhist activities in Manang communities are performed by lamas who speak Tibetan (or chant/read the language) in these contexts. However, the nine suspected Tibetan loanwords in this database are not of religious meanings, but rather express family relations, temporal notions, aspects of the modern world, or serve more interactional/discourse functions. This suggests that despite the continued exposure to Tibetan through religious activities, there has been little impact on the Manange lexicon in this way.",,1,,1

202,,cs-9129144427566582,Contact with Gününa Yajüch [41],"Beyond the fact that the Mapuche’s adoption of the horse in the 16th century led to a more massive and stable trade, cultural, and linguistic contact, the relationship between the Mapuche west of the Andes and the peoples east of the Andes dates back to pre-colonial times (Boschin personal communication, Hajduk 1982, Silveira 1996). ; One of these peoples was the Gününa Küne of northern Patagonia, also known as Pampa and northern Tehuelche. Their geographic dispersion reached the province of Buenos Aires and southeastern La Pampa province, the southern coasts of the Colorado and Negro Rivers, the province of Río Negro and central and western Chubut, bordering on the south with the Senguerr River (Harrington 1946). ; Loanwords from Gününa Yajüch, the Gününa Küne’s language, have been documented in Mapudungun, especially in the varieties spoken in the provinces of Chubut and La Pampa. Tomás Harrington was the first to identify a list of these loanwords in Mapudungun (Harrington 1912-1955), most of which were nouns belonging to semantic domains like flora, fauna, and hunting. Some of these terms were then published in Casamiquela (1962).

203,,cs-9129144347005304,Contact with Quechua [41],"Contact with Quechua dates back to pre-Hispanic periods. In the mid-15th century, under Tupac Yupanqui, the Inca – in their plan for expansion to the south – invaded northern Chile and occupied the Mapuche territories reaching as far as the Maule River. Before long, the territory between the Copiapo Valley and the Maule River was politically incorporated into the Inca kollasuyu ‘southern empire’ (Mostny 1992). The imperial army followed by imperial officials and settlers imposed Inca rule and socio-cultural organization, the payment of tributes and taxes, and their language, Quechua, on the Mapuche people living in the area. This population also adopted Andean agricultural technology and soft metal working technology (for gold, silver, and copper). They were incorporated into the communal and collective work imposed by the Inca Empire and its socioeconomic system, as laborers, artisans, and soldiers. Finally, after strong resistance, by 1480 the central Mapuche repelled the Inca invasion, preventing the Inca army from conquering the local population south the Bío-Bío River. ; Inca domination was relatively brief since the Inca Empire collapsed around 1520 owing to the Spanish conquest. However, during the colonial domination, contact with Quechua may have continued through Quechua speakers who joined or were forced to join the Spanish army.; Although the Inca system had been fully installed in territories north of the Maule River and contact with Quechua continued during the colonial period, Inca cultural and linguistic influence on the Mapuche living south of the Itata and Bío-Bío Rivers was not profound (Cooper 1946). However, traces of this first contact can be found in a set of Quechua words borrowed in Mapudungun (see 5.2. and the Appendix). Finally, the presence of Quechua loanwords in the Ranquel variety, as well as the Mapudungun loanwords documented in the variety of Quechua spoken in northwestern Argentina (Nardi 1962), confirm the pre- and post-conquest relationship between the inhabitants of Argentina’s northwestern region and the Pampa and Patagonia regions.",,1,,1
204,,cs-9129144627370336,Contact with Spanish [41],"The first contact with Spanish dates back to 1536 when Pedro de Valdivia and the Spanish army invaded the Mapocho Valley, founding the city of Santiago de Chile. During the 16th century Chile’s indigenous population is estimated to have reached one million, and the Mapuche living between the Elqui Valley and the Island of Chiloé at around 600,000. The Mapuche are one of the last indigenous peoples in the Americas to resist European subjugation until the end of the 19th century. For more than three centuries the Mapuche fought against the Whites – first the Spaniards, and then the Chilean and Argentine national armies. It was only after 1880 that the Mapuche on both sides of the Andes were conclusively defeated (Smeets 1989, Golluscio 2006).; When the Spaniards invaded Chile, they easily conquered the indigenous territories formerly occupied by the Inca. However, the Mapuche south of the Bío-Bío River fiercely resisted Spanish attempts to establish forts and towns, attacking and destroying the conquerors’ settlements in the Araucanian territory again and again (Cooper 1946:696). As Jofré says, “The war of the Arauco cost Spain more than all the conquest of America” (cited in Smeets 1989:6).; In the mid-17th century, the king of Spain recognized Mapuche sovereignty from the Bío-Bío River to the town of Valdivia. This treaty allowed them to retain their language and own cultural practices over a long period, in addition to incorporating Spanish agricultural techniques and tools for the adoption of European plants and foods.  ; Particularly important in the Mapuche’s expansion to the eastern Andean territories and in their struggle against the Spaniards was the adoption and use of the horse in the early post-conquest period. This allowed them freedom of movement in their military campaigns, a means to cover wider distances, and a systematic exchange with peoples east of the Andes. Up to the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th century, the interaction between peoples on both sides of the Andes was firmly established.  ; From the foundation of the nation-states in Argentina and in Chile in the second half of the 19th century, their population and economic development policies did not promote the integration of the indigenous peoples, but rather fostered their exclusion and extermination. Military attacks both in Chile and in Argentina defeated them after years of resistance. The pre-existing treaties were disregarded, the survivors were forced to occupy the poorest land, and the culture and language of their ancestors could only be practiced in domestic and inner domains. Hiding strategies were widely implemented by the Mapuche people. As in the rest of the Americas, language and culture have been transmitted through subjacent channels, “the deep rivers”, in the words of the Peruvian anthropologist and writer José Arguedas (Arguedas 1958).; However, the ongoing pressure of Spanish has been strong and the preservation of Mapudungun has become increasingly more difficult. In the 1990s, Salas emphasized the significant number of Mapuche people in Chile who were neither competent in Mapudungun nor in Spanish (Salas 1992). In Argentina, military domination was accompanied by a systematic and efficient Hispanicizing monolingual national program of primary education throughout the country that partly contributed to narrowing the domains to use the indigenous languages.",,1,,1

305,,cs-9129144511041276,Spanish contact [32],"English to Spanish to Yaqui:  The adoption of English words into Yaqui took place principally in two types of situations: through Mexican Spanish which have previously adopted some loanwords from English, e.g. picheel ‘jug/pitcher’, or through US officers and workers which at the end of the 19th century participated in the construction of the railway track. An example of this last situation is Suichi < English switch, which is the modern noun of Vícam, an old Yaqui town, that came to be named Suichi ‘the place where the trains change their way’.
 
Hispanic Arabic to Spanish to Yaqui: People of Arabic origin first arrived in Spain at the beginning of the 8th century (year of 711.) This influx of Arabic influence continued up until the end of the 15th century (1492).  “Hispanic Arabic” influenced Spanish with many words, though not all of them can be traced in Yaqui.  

Nahuatl to Spanish to Yaqui: Nahuatl was used as a lingua franca during the first years of the Spanish colonization in Mexico.  When the Spaniards entered the Yaqui lands at the beginning of the 17th century, hundred of Nahuatl speakers accompanied them. Most Nahuatl words entered Yaqui via Spanish, but it could’ve been possible for some words to have been adopted directly from Nahuatl; it should be noted though that such a contact situation is not applied in this database.   
No information

Quechua to Spanish to Yaqui: During the Spanish contact with indigenous languages of the New world, names of animals and plants were adopted. Only one original word from Quechua is included within the database; papa, or ‘potato’. The Yaqui adopted the loanword via Spanish. 

Taino to Spanish to Yaqui:  Some words of apparently Taino provenance were adopted in Spanish.  Yaqui speakers adopted these Taino words from Spanish speakers: e.g. kanoa ‘canoe’, kama < Spanish caiman ‘alligator’",,1,,1

However, since this is based on archaeological data, there is no absolute time known. The genetic dates have large standard errors, so that they do not give any precise information; but there is evidence of a founder event (e.g. the migration north) taking place in the period between 700 and 1500 CE (Pakendorf et al. 2006). Given the large number of Mongolic loanwords in the language, one might assume that the migration north (and thus the contact with the Evenks) took place not before the heyday of the Mongol Empire, i.e. not before the 13th century. 
As to when the contact situation ended, we really have no idea. We very arbitrarily put an end year of 1700 to this, because this is approximately the time when the Sakha became more numerous and more dominant in Yakutia and thus might not have copied words from the language of a minority group anymore.
